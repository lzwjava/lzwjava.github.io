<p><em>2024.11.29</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The reason people worsen their eyesight is that they use glasses with full prescription (which lets them see a blackboard clearly at 5m) to look at phones, computers, or books most of the time. This causes their eyeballs to deform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After using glasses with a 150-200 degree reduction for several days, you won’t want to go back to full prescription glasses. The latter becomes very uncomfortable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding myopia is key - it’s caused by eye muscle changes, not just genetics or light exposure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important principle is “just barely clear” - wear glasses that make things just clear enough without straining.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For computer or phone use, a 150-200 degree reduction often works well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep a stronger prescription pair for driving and essential tasks requiring perfect vision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expect slow progress - about 25 degrees reduction every three months is good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t aim for perfect clarity. Slightly blurry vision is part of the improvement process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the formula: Myopia degree = 100/clear distance (in meters) for rough assessment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t force yourself to see clearly - let your eyes adjust naturally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn about your eye mechanics - understanding how external eye muscles work helps make better vision choices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Myopia requires wearing glasses, which can be troublesome during activities like playing basketball or when wearing a hat. The hat cannot stretch to cover more skin and provide warmth because the glasses take up space. Forgetting to wear glasses also affects vision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While some people may feel too old or lazy to address their myopia, it’s crucial to take action for the sake of future generations to prevent the same challenges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improvement process takes time - myopia developed over years will take time to improve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that most of the time, our eyes can clearly see the objects we want to view. If we move objects about 10 cm farther away, they become unclear. This indicates that we are using our eyes correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we use phones or computers most of the time, we need to reduce the prescription strength of our eyeglasses to use our eyes correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the case of presbyopia lenses. As people age, their eye muscles change shape in a direction opposite to that in myopia. We can apply the principles used in presbyopia lenses to myopia lenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recommend multifocal progressive lenses. Based on your prescription, assuming correct vision is 0.9, the suggestion is to make the additional correction for near vision +1.75 D in myopia (with astigmatism remaining unchanged), while the additional correction for far vision is +1.00 D in myopia (with astigmatism remaining unchanged).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>2025.07.11</em></p>

<p>After Yin Wang proposed the myopia reversal method in his <a href="https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2022/02/22/myopia">blog</a>, there have been some opposing views on this. I happened to read some views.</p>

<p>Since 2022, I have been conducting the experiment just as this <a href="http://localhost:4000/vision-restoration-en">paper</a> describes.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to know what is right or wrong. It is incorrect to say that heredity is the primary risk factor for myopia. In Todd Becker’s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Efg42-Qn0">Video</a>, in the introduction, there is a paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Myopia, or near-sightedness, is generally assumed to be an irreversible, genetically determined condition that can only be ameliorated with corrective lenses or surgery. Its prevalence is 30-40% in the U.S. and Europe, and more than 50% in some Asian countries, but it is rare in Africa and in pre-industrial cultures. The incidence of myopia correlates with IQ, school achievement, and industrialization, suggesting that an environmental factor is at work—namely, near-work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my experience, I can say this is correct. My father has 3 brothers. Three out of the 4 siblings don’t have myopia, while one does. The youngest brother of my father has myopia and has the highest education, probably a bachelor’s degree. They were born in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>For myself, I started developing myopia when I was in junior high school around 2009. At that time, I probably had around -2.00 diopters. I recall that I stayed up at night and used my Nokia phone while lying in bed with the lights off. After a summer like that, I felt that my eyesight had become poor.</p>

<p>I happen to know some of the authors of opposing views. They also blog or comment. After I conducted a 3-year experiment, and Yin Wang tried so many ways to reverse myopia, the first thought when I see such opposing views on the Internet is that we don’t care. They don’t know how much effort we have made, how we rejected our ideas or started again, how we adjusted our experiments, or how we mulled over all these things.</p>

<p>The author has a good heart in warning us about Yin Wang’s discovery. But really, the author has not yet conducted experiments on it. I agree with a lot of his ideas about startups, as he has a 10-year startup journey. But for myopia itself, most of our efforts in experiments or reading—and most human discoveries or discussions about it—don’t matter. Only a few truths matter.</p>

<p>We are not disrespectful towards the opposing views. Science is science. It doesn’t matter that there are 2 billion people with myopia. And a large number of them use eyeglasses with full prescription that allow them to see a blackboard 5m away, but they use them to look at mobile phones a lot. That’s why their myopia becomes deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>One easy way to know whether what Yin Wang says is true is to just put down your glasses. If your myopia is just 175 or 200 degrees, you can see your mobile phone without needing glasses. And if you are wearing eyeglasses with full prescription, you can put the mobile phone far away, like 80 cm or 1 meter, and you probably can still see the words on the screen.</p>

<p>I can see that one of the big mistakes is that they don’t do hands-on experiments while we do a lot and think about them extensively. They just say what the book says.</p>

<p>In the corporate world, I can see this scenario too. In a team, engineers and leaders may come up with solutions. However, half of them probably don’t work. We need to try the solutions to see what happens. It is just like the tens of thousands of times I thought that code should work but testing failed in my 10 years of software engineering experience.</p>

<p>From the hands-on aspect, we actually can do a lot of filtering. We should hire, communicate, and work with those people who are more hands-on. In the company, those who like hands-on work will probably be better leaders. Steve Jobs once highlighted the importance of highly performant individual contributors.</p>

<p>So when judging the quality or truthfulness of opinions, we can check their hands-on degree. Does the author do a lot of experiments?</p>

<p>And I can see that people who do a lot of hands-on experiments actually don’t hold their opinions too rigidly. I know there is still doubt in reversing myopia. What degree is best for reversing myopia, whether 150 degrees less, or 200 degrees less? I wrote a paper about this, <a href="https://lzwjava.github.io/barely-clear-en">Natural Vision Restoration: The Principle of “Just Barely Clear”</a>.</p>

<p>It is really easy to talk, but harder to perform actual experiments, work out a theory, and then test again, just like writing code.</p>

<p>It’s easy to make mistakes without hands-on experience. After making tons of mistakes, you will realize that compared to the losses or pain that the mistakes cause us, the trouble of doing a lot of hands-on experiments to get to the truth and avoid mistakes is negligible. That said, like in stock investing, one day you will know that compared to the losses or pain that investing mistakes cause us, the trouble of performing hands-on, thorough experimental efforts to invest successfully is negligible.</p>

<p>As reversing myopia naturally is kind of slow, just like losing weight. In my 3 years of experience (from February 2022 to January 2025), I achieved the following:</p>

<p>Let’s use Python to draw a paragraph about it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/research/progress.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>So, you need to be patient about it.</p>

<h3 id="do-the-right-thing-results-will-happen">Do the Right Thing, Results Will Happen</h3>

<p>As long as you do the right thing, results will happen. Just like losing weight, eating very little and playing sports often will help you lose weight. If you lose 1 kg every month, then one year you will lose 12 kg.</p>

<p>Similarly, in learning, if we study 10 hours a day, then one year it amounts to 3,650 hours.</p>

<p>The good news for reversing myopia is that there is nothing hard about it that you cannot persist with. It just requires you to see a mobile phone or computer screen barely clearly.</p>

<p>This is a better and more comfortable way to proceed. The cost of using the correct method is that I need to prepare another pair of eyeglasses with full prescriptions to drive, see views while traveling, and watch movies in theaters.</p>

<p>Those times in life are actually just a small part, like at most 2 hours in a day, with the remaining 15 hours being awake.</p>

<h3 id="dont-settle-continue-to-improve">Don’t Settle, Continue to Improve</h3>

<p>In the first year, my primary activity involved computer work, during which I wore glasses with a 1.50 diopter reduction. This setup allowed me to frequently experience the “just barely clear” state, where vision was sufficiently clear without being overly sharp. However, in the second year, as I shifted my focus to studying for my associate degree at home, I reduced my computer usage and primarily relied on my mobile phone for reading materials and exercises.</p>

<p>After talking with a friend, I started to learn about bifocal lenses and multifocal progressive lenses. I even learned terms like segment height, segment position, and working distance for vision.</p>

<p>It required a lot of experimentation. Grasping the principle, the solutions can vary—from a plain +1.50D addition to the prescription, to a +2.00D addition, and then using multifocal progressive lenses to help. There are still ways to improve.</p>

<p>After ChatGPT came out, there have been many improvements. A lot of smart people are thinking in that direction. In the real world, there are many use cases and more real problems to solve.</p>

<p>For reversing myopia, it is exactly the same. Older people use presbyopia lenses.</p>

<h3 id="share-to-the-urgently-needy">Share to the Urgently Needy</h3>

<p>Though I shared my reversing myopia article on the WeChat Subscription Platform in June 2023, in December 2024, I received a reply from someone who claimed his 12-year-old kid was frustrated with his myopia degree of 500, that is, -5.00. When I was 12, I thought I had just begun to wear glasses for myopia with a degree of -2.00.</p>

<p>As the truth or discovery is less known to people, only those in urgent need want to try this. This reversing myopia method, probably first introduced by Todd Becker in 2014, will become popular one day.</p>

<p>There are no negative effects of the new adjustment method. Additionally, more and more people will develop myopia, and their myopia degrees will become larger and larger.</p>

<h3 id="does-a-conspiracy-exist-in-the-popularity-of-myopia">Does a Conspiracy Exist in the Popularity of Myopia</h3>

<p>People wearing full degrees of eyeglasses have caused their myopia to deepen. The myopia isn’t made by someone deliberately. It is just that human beings are not careful. It seems normal to wear full degrees to regain normal eyesight of 5.0, the eyesight of a child.</p>

<p>However, what human beings don’t know is that they use them to look at near objects. The people who invented multifocal progressive lenses or vision testers knew a lot about how the eye or myopia works.</p>

<p>So, the improvement here is just that we categorize how we use our eyes. We observe that human beings nowadays are mostly using phones or computers. And it doesn’t matter that we see things far away vaguely in daily life.</p>

<p>The point is that most of the time, our eyes can clearly see the objects we want to view. If we move objects about 10 cm farther away, they become unclear. This indicates that we are using our eyes correctly.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-new-discoveries-again">How to Find New Discoveries Again</h3>

<p>Try to observe and learn more on the Internet. Be careful of minor opinions. Try experimenting by yourself.</p>

<p>There are a lot of improvements in life. After the truth was found, it seems obvious. People just haven’t thought about it before. Steve Jobs surely understood it. Steve Jobs’ “Think Different” campaign is good.</p>

<h3 id="more-confident-to-improve-the-world">More Confident to Improve the World</h3>

<p>With so many people wearing glasses, whenever I see people wearing them - whether offline or online - I recognize there’s room for improvement in this area.</p>

<p>Their eyeglasses are too strong for viewing mobile phones or computers, which will cause their myopia to progressively worsen.</p>
