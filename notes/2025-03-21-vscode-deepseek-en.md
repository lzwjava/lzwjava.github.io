### Key Points
- It seems likely that CodeGPT and Cline are the main VSCode plugins supporting DeepSeek API keys for code assistance.
- Research suggests both plugins allow configuration with a DeepSeek API key for enhanced AI features like code completion.
- The evidence leans toward CodeGPT requiring an API key for cloud-based DeepSeek models, while Cline supports both local and API-based usage.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
If you're looking to use your DeepSeek API key in VSCode for code assistance, you're in luck—there are plugins that can help. The main options are the CodeGPT and Cline extensions, which seem to support DeepSeek API keys for features like code completion and generation.

#### Supported Plugins
- **CodeGPT Extension**: This plugin lets you integrate DeepSeek by selecting it as a provider and entering your API key. You'll need to get the key from [DeepSeek's platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) and configure it in the extension for cloud-based AI assistance.
- **Cline Extension**: Cline also supports DeepSeek API keys, especially for more accurate results when using cloud models. It can be set up to use your API key, offering features like code generation and debugging, alongside local model options.

#### Unexpected Detail
Interestingly, while CodeGPT is straightforward for cloud-based DeepSeek usage, Cline offers flexibility by supporting both local and API-based models, which might be useful if you want to switch based on your needs.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of VSCode Plugins Supporting DeepSeek API Keys

This section provides a detailed examination of VSCode plugins that support DeepSeek API keys, expanding on the direct answer with a thorough review of available options, setup processes, and additional considerations. The analysis is grounded in recent web-based research, ensuring accuracy and relevance as of March 21, 2025.

#### Background on DeepSeek and VSCode Integration
DeepSeek is an AI model provider offering services for code intelligence, with API keys available for cloud-based access through [their platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). VSCode, a popular code editor, supports various extensions for AI-assisted coding, and users with DeepSeek API keys may seek to leverage these for enhanced productivity. The integration typically involves configuring extensions to use the API key for accessing DeepSeek's models, such as deepseek-chat or deepseek-coder, for tasks like code completion, generation, and debugging.

#### Identified Plugins Supporting DeepSeek API Keys
Through extensive web research, two primary VSCode extensions were identified as supporting DeepSeek API keys: CodeGPT and Cline. Below, we detail their functionality, setup, and suitability for users with DeepSeek API keys.

##### CodeGPT Extension
- **Description**: CodeGPT is a versatile VSCode extension that supports multiple AI providers, including DeepSeek, for code-related tasks. It is designed for cloud-based model usage, making it ideal for users with API keys.
- **Setup Process**:
  - Obtain your DeepSeek API key from [DeepSeek's platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
  - In VSCode, open the CodeGPT extension and navigate to the chat settings.
  - Select "LLMs Cloud" as the model type, then choose DeepSeek as the provider.
  - Paste the API key and click "Connect."
  - Choose a model, such as deepseek-chat, and begin using it for code assistance.
- **Features**: Supports code completion, chat-based code generation, and other AI-driven features, leveraging DeepSeek's cloud models for real-time assistance.
- **Advantages**: Straightforward integration for cloud-based usage, well-documented in [CodeGPT's documentation](https://docs.codegpt.co/docs/tutorial-ai-providers/deepseek).
- **Limitations**: Primarily cloud-based, which may incur costs based on API usage, and less flexible for local setups.

##### Cline Extension
- **Description**: Cline is an open-source VSCode plugin that seamlessly integrates with AI models like DeepSeek, offering both local and cloud-based options. It is particularly noted for its flexibility in supporting API keys for enhanced performance.
- **Setup Process**:
  - Install Cline from the VSCode Marketplace.
  - For API-based usage, configure the extension to connect to DeepSeek by entering your API key in the settings. This is mentioned in various guides, such as [a blog post on using DeepSeek with Cline](https://apidog.com/blog/free-deepseek-r1-vscode-cline/), which highlights API configuration for better accuracy.
  - Select the desired DeepSeek model (e.g., deepseek-v3) and use it for code generation, modification, and debugging.
- **Features**: Offers code completion, autonomous coding agent capabilities, and visualized code modifications, with support for both local and cloud models. It is noted for lower latency when using DeepSeek's API, as per [a comparison with other tools](https://www.chatstream.org/en/blog/cline-deepseek-alternative).
- **Advantages**: Flexible for users who want both local and cloud options, cost-effective with DeepSeek's low API costs, and transparent in AI operations.
- **Limitations**: May require additional setup for API integration compared to CodeGPT, and performance may vary based on hardware for local models.

#### Additional Considerations and Alternatives
While CodeGPT and Cline are the primary plugins supporting DeepSeek API keys, other extensions were explored but found less relevant:
- **DeepSeek Code Generator**: Listed in the VSCode Marketplace, this extension generates code using DeepSeek AI, but there is insufficient information to confirm API key support, as seen in [its marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidDai.deepseek-code-generator). It may be a newer or less documented option.
- **Roo Code and Other Extensions**: Mentioned in some articles for integrating DeepSeek R1, these focus more on local setups and do not explicitly support API keys, as per [a DEV Community post](https://dev.to/dwtoledo/how-to-use-deepseek-r1-for-free-in-visual-studio-code-with-cline-or-roo-code-3an9).
- **DeepSeek for GitHub Copilot**: This extension runs DeepSeek models in GitHub Copilot Chat, but it is specific to Copilot and not a standalone plugin for DeepSeek API key usage, as seen in [its marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wassimdev.wassimdev-vscode-deepseek).

#### Comparative Analysis
To aid in decision-making, the following table compares CodeGPT and Cline based on key criteria:

| **Criteria**          | **CodeGPT**                              | **Cline**                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **API Key Support**   | Yes, for cloud-based DeepSeek models     | Yes, for enhanced cloud-based performance|
| **Local Model Support** | No, cloud-only                          | Yes, supports local models like DeepSeek R1 |
| **Ease of Setup**     | Straightforward, well-documented         | May require additional configuration for API |
| **Cost**              | API usage costs apply                   | Lower API costs with DeepSeek, free for local |
| **Features**          | Code completion, chat-based assistance   | Code generation, visualized modifications, autonomous coding |
| **Best For**          | Users focused on cloud-based AI assistance | Users wanting flexibility between local and cloud |

#### Usage Tips and Best Practices
- For users with DeepSeek API keys, start with CodeGPT for a simpler setup if cloud-based assistance is sufficient. The process is detailed in [CodeGPT's DeepSeek tutorial](https://docs.codegpt.co/docs/tutorial-ai-providers/deepseek).
- For those needing both local and cloud options, Cline is recommended, especially for cost savings with DeepSeek's low API costs (as low as $0.01 per million tokens, per [a blog post](https://apidog.com/blog/free-deepseek-r1-vscode-cline/)). Ensure your API key is configured correctly for optimal performance.
- Always review AI-generated code for accuracy, as models may occasionally produce plausible but incorrect suggestions, a common consideration in AI-assisted coding.

#### Conclusion
In summary, CodeGPT and Cline are the most reliable VSCode plugins for using DeepSeek API keys, offering robust features for code assistance. CodeGPT is ideal for cloud-based setups, while Cline provides flexibility for both local and cloud usage, catering to diverse user needs as of March 21, 2025. Users should consider their hardware, cost preferences, and desired features when choosing between them.
