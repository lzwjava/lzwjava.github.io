Apologies for the confusion; the `--skip-existing` flag is not a valid option in `pip`. To continue installing packages from a requirements file despite failures, you can use the `--no-dependencies` flag to avoid dependency conflicts or handle errors manually. However, the best approach to skip failed packages and continue installing others is to use a loop in a shell script. Here's a one-liner command to attempt installing each package from `requirements.top.txt` individually, ignoring failures:

```bash
while read -r package; do pip install --ignore-installed "$package" || true; done < scripts/requirements/requirements.top.txt
```

### Explanation:
- `while read -r package`: Reads each line (package) from the requirements file.
- `pip install --ignore-installed "$package"`: Attempts to install each package, ignoring already installed versions.
- `|| true`: Ensures the loop continues even if a package installation fails (e.g., due to version incompatibilities like `tensorflow` with Python 3.13).
- `< scripts/requirements/requirements.top.txt`: Specifies the path to your requirements file.

### Notes:
- **TensorFlow Issue**: The error you encountered earlier indicates `tensorflow` is incompatible with Python 3.13. You may need to use Python 3.12 or earlier for `tensorflow`. To proceed:
  1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.12:
     ```bash
     python3.12 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
  2. Run the command above in the activated environment.
- **Dependencies**: `--no-dependencies` can be added to the `pip install` command inside the loop (`pip install --ignore-installed --no-dependencies "$package" || true`) to avoid dependency conflicts, but this may cause issues if packages rely on specific dependencies.
- **Alternative**: If you want to exclude problematic packages like `tensorflow`, edit `requirements.top.txt` to remove them or specify compatible versions (e.g., `tensorflow==2.17.0` for Python 3.12).

If you encounter further issues or need help modifying the requirements file, let me know!
