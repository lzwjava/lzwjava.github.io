When you build or use an **LLM API**, you generally want safeguards to ensure the responses are safe, valid, and useful. Here are the main ways to add checks:

---

### 1. **Input Validation**

* **Schema checks**: Ensure the request JSON follows the expected schema before sending to the LLM.
* **Prompt sanitization**: Strip or escape unwanted characters, malicious instructions, or injection attempts.
* **Length checks**: Enforce max token/character limits for inputs to avoid unnecessary cost or truncation.

---

### 2. **Output Validation**

* **JSON schema validation**: If the LLM is supposed to return JSON, run it through `json.loads()` and validate against a schema (e.g., with `pydantic`, `jsonschema`).
* **Regex/format checks**: For emails, URLs, or numbers, enforce patterns.
* **Type checking**: Verify that fields are of the right type (string, integer, list, etc.).
* **Range checks**: Ensure numeric or date values are within expected bounds.

---

### 3. **Safety and Content Checks**

* **Toxicity or profanity filters**: Run output through a classifier (e.g., Perspective API, OpenAI moderation API).
* **Policy filters**: Define rules to block responses containing certain keywords or categories.
* **Hallucination detection**: Add fact-checking steps (via retrieval-augmented checks, multiple model cross-validation, or rule-based sanity checks).

---

### 4. **Business Logic Constraints**

* **Consistency rules**: If the response must match system data (e.g., available account balance, config values), cross-verify before returning to the user.
* **Guardrails**: Use libraries like **Guardrails AI**, **LMQL**, or **Instructor** to enforce structured outputs and constraints declaratively.
* **Post-processing hooks**: Wrap LLM responses with custom logic (normalize casing, enforce defaults, reject unexpected answers).

---

### 5. **Redundancy & Cross-Verification**

* **Self-check prompts**: Ask the LLM to re-validate or explain its own answer.
* **Dual-model checking**: Use a smaller/faster LLM to verify the main model’s output (e.g., "does this response conform to schema X?").
* **Voting/consensus**: Run multiple calls and compare answers for stability.

---

### 6. **Operational Safeguards**

* **Rate limits**: Prevent abuse of the API.
* **Timeouts**: Abort requests that hang.
* **Logging and audit trails**: Keep record of requests and filtered responses.
* **Fallbacks**: If validation fails, either retry with adjusted prompt, or return a safe default/error.

👉 In practice, a good LLM API stack layers these:

1. Validate input.
2. Call LLM.
3. Validate output against schema + business rules.
4. Run safety/content filters.
5. Return only if checks pass (else retry/fallback).

Would you like me to show you a **Python example** where we wrap an LLM API call with JSON schema validation and moderation checks?
