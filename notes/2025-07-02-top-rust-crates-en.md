It's challenging to provide an exact "top 100" list by real-time download count, as such specific metrics aren't publicly and dynamically ranked by Crates.io in that granular way. However, based on general popularity, extensive use in projects, and impact on the Rust ecosystem, here's a list of highly influential and widely used Rust libraries (crates), with a brief description for each. This list considers factors like direct download numbers (where available from Lib.rs/Crates.io, though these fluctuate), transitive dependencies (how many other crates depend on them), and community recognition.

**Note:** The download counts provided by Lib.rs (which gathers data from Crates.io) are constantly changing. The numbers below are approximate as of early July 2025 and are meant to give a sense of scale.
