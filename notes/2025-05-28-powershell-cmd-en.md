PowerShell and Command Prompt (cmd.exe) are both command-line interfaces used in Windows environments, but they have distinct differences in terms of functionality, scripting capabilities, and overall power. Here's a comparison:

### PowerShell vs. Command Prompt

1. **Language and Syntax:**
   - **Command Prompt (cmd.exe):** Uses a simple batch scripting language. It's less powerful and lacks the object-oriented approach. Commands are often text-based and less flexible.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses a more advanced scripting language based on .NET. It supports object-oriented programming, which allows for more complex and powerful scripting.

2. **Commandlets vs. Commands:**
   - **Command Prompt:** Relies on a limited set of built-in commands (like `dir`, `copy`, `del`) and external utilities.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets"), which are specialized .NET classes designed for particular tasks. Cmdlets are more consistent and powerful, following a verb-noun naming convention (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`, `Copy-Item`).

3. **Scripting Capabilities:**
   - **Command Prompt:** Scripting is done through batch files (.bat or .cmd). These scripts are less powerful and can be cumbersome for complex tasks.
   - **PowerShell:** Scripting is done through PowerShell scripts (.ps1). These scripts are more powerful, supporting advanced programming constructs like loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - **Command Prompt:** Output is typically plain text, which can be harder to manipulate and parse.
   - **PowerShell:** Output is object-based, making it easier to manipulate and process data. You can pipe objects between cmdlets to perform complex operations.

5. **Integration and Extensibility:**
   - **Command Prompt:** Limited integration with other Windows features and external tools.
   - **PowerShell:** Deep integration with Windows and other Microsoft products. It can leverage the full power of the .NET Framework and can be extended with modules and snap-ins.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - **Command Prompt:** Basic error handling capabilities.
   - **PowerShell:** Advanced error handling with try-catch blocks and detailed error messages.

### Is PowerShell Better?

For most tasks, especially those involving automation, system administration, and complex scripting, PowerShell is generally considered superior to Command Prompt. Its advanced features, object-oriented approach, and deep integration with Windows make it a more powerful and flexible tool.

### Script Writing in PowerShell

Writing scripts in PowerShell involves creating .ps1 files that contain PowerShell commands and logic. Here are some key points:

- **Syntax:** PowerShell scripts use a syntax similar to other programming languages, with support for variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Cmdlets:** Utilize cmdlets to perform tasks. Cmdlets are designed to be intuitive and consistent.
- **Modules:** PowerShell modules allow you to extend functionality by importing additional cmdlets and functions.
- **Error Handling:** Use try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.
- **Pipelines:** Leverage the pipeline to pass objects between cmdlets, enabling complex data manipulation.

### Example PowerShell Script

```powershell
# Example PowerShell script to list files in a directory and filter by extension
$directory = "C:\Example"
$extension = ".txt"

Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -Filter "*$extension" | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "File: $($_.Name), Size: $($_.Length) bytes"
}
```

In summary, PowerShell offers significant advantages over Command Prompt, particularly for scripting and automation tasks. Its advanced features and integration with the Windows ecosystem make it a powerful tool for system administrators and power users.
