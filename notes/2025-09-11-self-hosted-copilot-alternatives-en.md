You're asking for open-source tools to self-host a “Copilot-like” experience locally—tools you can run yourself (with your own token or model), perhaps integrated into VS Code or other IDEs. No tables, just clean, clear explanations. Here are the best-known options:

---

### **Tabby**

A self-hosted AI coding assistant written in Rust. It's open-source, requires no external services, and offers an OpenAPI-style interface—making integration with local IDEs and infrastructure straightforward. It even supports consumer-grade GPUs and editor integrations including Vim/Neovim. ([GitHub][1], [Software Recommendations Stack Exchange][2])

---

### **FauxPilot**

An open-source project designed as a locally hosted alternative to GitHub Copilot. It leverages Salesforce’s CodeGen models running via NVIDIA’s Triton Inference Server (and FasterTransformer). Deployable via Docker, it’s compatible with Copilot-like clients and works best with a capable GPU. ([GitHub][3])

---

### **Privy**

Another MIT-licensed, open-source tool that runs locally. It offers real-time code completion and chat functionality akin to GitHub Copilot. It can integrate with LLM runtimes like Ollama, llama.cpp, or llamafile, and supports popular coding models (like CodeLlama variants) depending on your hardware. ([GitHub][4])

---

### **GPT4All, Continue, LocalPilot** *(and similar)*

Mentioned among several self-hosted tools alongside Tabby and FauxPilot; these provide local privacy-minded coding assistance. While not always as polished, they’re viable if hardware constraints or specific workflows call for them. ([Virtualization Howto][5])

---

### **Ollama (with Docker)**

Not a full Copilot replacement on its own, but a powerful open-source tool for running LLMs locally. You can host models like Phi-2 using Ollama via Docker, and then connect to them through VS Code using an LLM extension (e.g. Hugging Face’s `llm-vscode`). This allows you to essentially chat with or get code assistance from a local model. ([Tommaso Colella][6], [Reddit][7])

---

### **Community Buzz**

From Reddit discussions:

* “Self host your own ‘Copilot’ for FREE with Ollama AI on a docker server” — highlighting Ollama’s effectiveness and integration with VS Code. ([Reddit][7])
* “Tabby is (now) the most popular ‘open-source & local’ tool” — pointing to its growing adoption. ([Reddit][8])

---

### **Summary Recommendations**

* **If you're after a polished, open-source Copilot alternative:** start with **Tabby**.
* **If you want something closer to Copilot’s infrastructure (and have a solid GPU):** check out **FauxPilot**.
* **If you want code + chat features with flexibility on models/runtime:** try **Privy**.
* **Want full control over endpoints and models?** Pair **Ollama** with your own LLM, then connect using standard LLM interfaces.

---

### **Next Steps for You**

1. **Assess hardware:** FauxPilot and Privy may require a decent GPU; Tabby is more lightweight.
2. **Choose a runtime/framework:**

   * **Tabby**: great all-around choice with editor support.
   * **FauxPilot**: Copilot-like with Docker and Triton.
   * **Privy**: flexible, model-agnostic setup.
   * **Ollama + LLM**: pure DIY—great if you're comfortable building endpoints yourself.
3. **Connect to your IDE:** VS Code (or others) support using these via local endpoints, just like Copilot.
