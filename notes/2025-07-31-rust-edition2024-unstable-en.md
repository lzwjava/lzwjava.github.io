The error occurs because your Rust project is trying to use the `edition2024` feature, which is not stabilized in your current Cargo version (1.75.0). To resolve this, you need to opt into the unstable `edition2024` feature explicitly.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Enable the `edition2024` Feature**:
   Open your `Cargo.toml` file and add the following line at the very top, before the `[package]` section:

   ```toml
   cargo-features = ["edition2024"]
   ```

   For example, your `Cargo.toml` might look like this:

   ```toml
   cargo-features = ["edition2024"]

   [package]
   name = "your_project_name"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2024"
   ```

2. **Use a Nightly Rust Toolchain**:
   Since `edition2024` is an unstable feature, you need to use the nightly Rust toolchain, as stable versions (like 1.75.0) don't support it. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   rustup update nightly
   rustup override set nightly
   ```

   The first command updates the nightly toolchain, and the second sets your project directory to use the nightly toolchain.

3. **Re-run the Build**:
   After making these changes, try building your project again:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Additional Notes:
- The `edition2024` feature is experimental and may change. Check the Rust documentation for updates on its status: [Rust Edition 2024](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#edition-2024).
- If you don’t need `edition2024`, you can revert to a stable edition (e.g., `edition = "2021"`) in `Cargo.toml` to avoid using the nightly toolchain.
- Ensure your `rustup` is up-to-date by running `rustup update`.

If you encounter further issues, share the contents of your `Cargo.toml` or any new error messages for more specific guidance.
