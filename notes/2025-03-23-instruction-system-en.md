## **1. Introduction to the Instruction System**  
An **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** defines the interface between software and hardware. It specifies the instructions a processor can execute, their formats, and how they interact with memory and registers. Understanding ISA is crucial for both programming (especially in assembly language) and designing computer hardware.

---

## **2. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**  
### **2.1 What is ISA?**  
The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** is the part of the processor's design that handles execution of instructions, including:  
- **Data types** (e.g., integers, floating points, characters)  
- **Registers** (temporary storage locations inside the CPU)  
- **Memory access methods** (how data is retrieved and stored)  
- **Instruction types** (arithmetic, logic, control, I/O)  

### **2.2 Types of ISAs**  
1. **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**  
   - A single instruction can perform multiple operations.  
   - Example: x86 architecture (Intel, AMD).  
   - **Advantages:** Fewer instructions per program, easier to program in assembly.  
   - **Disadvantages:** Slower instruction execution due to complexity.  

2. **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**  
   - Each instruction performs a simple operation and executes in a single cycle.  
   - Example: ARM, MIPS, RISC-V.  
   - **Advantages:** Faster execution, simpler hardware.  
   - **Disadvantages:** More instructions needed for complex tasks.

## **3. Instruction Formats**  
### **3.1 What is an Instruction Format?**  
An **instruction format** defines how an instruction is structured in memory. It consists of the following fields:  
1. **Opcode (Operation Code):** Specifies the operation (e.g., ADD, LOAD, STORE).  
2. **Operands:** Specifies the data (registers, memory addresses).  
3. **Addressing Mode:** Specifies how to access operands.  

### **3.2 Common Instruction Formats**  
1. **Fixed Format:**  
   - All instructions are the same size (e.g., 32-bit in MIPS).  
   - Easy to decode but may waste space.  

2. **Variable Format:**  
   - Instructions vary in size (e.g., x86, ARM).  
   - Efficient memory use but harder to decode.  

3. **Hybrid Format:**  
   - Combination of fixed and variable formats (e.g., ARM Thumb instructions).  

### **3.3 Example Instruction Format (MIPS Architecture)**  
In **MIPS**, an instruction is 32 bits long and has three main formats:  

1. **R-Type (Register-Type)**
   ```
   | Opcode (6) | Rs (5) | Rt (5) | Rd (5) | Shamt (5) | Funct (6) |
   ```
   - Example: `add $t1, $t2, $t3`  
   - Meaning: `$t1 = $t2 + $t3`  

2. **I-Type (Immediate-Type)**
   ```
   | Opcode (6) | Rs (5) | Rt (5) | Immediate (16) |
   ```
   - Example: `addi $t1, $t2, 10`  
   - Meaning: `$t1 = $t2 + 10`  

3. **J-Type (Jump-Type)**
   ```
   | Opcode (6) | Address (26) |
   ```
   - Example: `j 10000` (Jump to memory address 10000)  

---

## **4. Addressing Modes**  
**Addressing modes** determine how operands are accessed in an instruction.  

### **4.1 Common Addressing Modes**  
1. **Immediate Addressing:** The operand is directly specified in the instruction.  
   - Example: `addi $t1, $t2, 10` (10 is an immediate value)  

2. **Register Addressing:** The operand is stored in a register.  
   - Example: `add $t1, $t2, $t3` (all operands are in registers)  

3. **Direct Addressing:** The instruction contains the memory address of the operand.  
   - Example: `load $t1, 1000` (load value from memory address 1000)  

4. **Indirect Addressing:** The address of the operand is stored in a register.  
   - Example: `load $t1, ($t2)` (fetch value from the address stored in `$t2`)  

5. **Indexed Addressing:** The address is calculated by adding an offset to a register.  
   - Example: `load $t1, 10($t2)` (fetch value from `$t2 + 10`)  

6. **Base+Offset Addressing:** A base register and offset determine the address.  
   - Example: `lw $t1, 4($sp)` (fetch from `$sp + 4`)  

### **4.2 Importance of Addressing Modes**  
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Different addressing modes optimize memory access.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Some modes are faster than others.  
- **Flexibility:** Supports different programming styles (e.g., pointer arithmetic).

## **5. Assembly Language Programming**  
### **5.1 What is Assembly Language?**  
**Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that directly corresponds to machine code.  

### **5.2 Structure of an Assembly Program**  
A basic assembly program consists of:  
- **Directives:** Instructions to the assembler (e.g., `.data`, `.text`).  
- **Instructions:** Actual operations executed by the CPU.  

### **5.3 Basic MIPS Assembly Program**  
```assembly
.data
msg: .asciiz "Hello, World!"

.text
.globl main
main:
    li $v0, 4       # Load syscall code for print_string
    la $a0, msg     # Load address of string
    syscall         # Print string

    li $v0, 10      # Exit syscall
    syscall
```
- `.data` section stores variables and strings.  
- `.text` section contains executable instructions.  
- `syscall` is used to interact with the operating system.  

### **5.4 Key Assembly Instructions**  
| Instruction | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `add` | Add two registers | `add $t1, $t2, $t3` |
| `sub` | Subtract two registers | `sub $t1, $t2, $t3` |
| `lw` | Load word from memory | `lw $t1, 0($t2)` |
| `sw` | Store word to memory | `sw $t1, 0($t2)` |
| `beq` | Branch if equal | `beq $t1, $t2, label` |
| `j` | Jump to address | `j label` |

### **5.5 Assembly vs High-Level Languages**  
| Feature | Assembly | High-Level Language (C, Python) |
|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Speed** | Faster | Slower (more overhead) |
| **Control** | Full control over hardware | Abstracted from hardware |
| **Difficulty** | Complex syntax | Easier syntax |
| **Portability** | CPU-specific | Works across different CPUs |
