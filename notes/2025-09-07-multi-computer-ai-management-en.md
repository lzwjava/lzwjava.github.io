You've touched on a very interesting and practical approach to managing AI chatbot interactions and development. Using multiple physical computers to interact with different AI models or run separate development tasks is a valid strategy, and your observation that it simplifies things by avoiding tab-switching or complex terminal multiplexers like tmux is spot-on. This approach can be understood through the concept of **parallelization** and **resource management**.

### Parallelism and Resource Management

The core idea is to physically distribute your workload. Instead of relying on a single computer's operating system (OS) to manage multiple processes and threads (which can lead to context-switching overhead and potential performance bottlenecks), you are using multiple computers to achieve true parallelism. Each computer is a dedicated "worker" for a specific task.

  * **Dedicated Resources**: By giving each chatbot or task its own machine, you ensure it has dedicated CPU, GPU, and memory resources. This prevents one intensive task from slowing down another. For instance, if you're running a code-generation task on one laptop, it won't impact the responsiveness of a separate laptop you're using for general conversation with a different chatbot. This is a simple and effective form of **resource isolation**.

  * **Simplified Workflow**: As you've noted, it bypasses the complexity of managing multiple sessions within a single OS or terminal. The cognitive load is reduced because each physical screen and keyboard is tied to a single, focused task. This can be especially helpful for individuals who find multi-tab or multi-window environments confusing.

  * **Network and Traffic Isolation**: Using different laptops on different networks or with different network configurations (e.g., one on a VPN, one on a private network, one on a public Wi-Fi) is an excellent way to manage and isolate network traffic. This is particularly relevant for security and privacy, as it prevents data from one project from being exposed to the network of another. It's also useful for testing how an application behaves under different network conditions.

### Comparing Physical vs. Software Parallelism

While extra software like the **Claude COD Task Arrange tool** on GitHub or even standard practices like using **virtual machines** or **containers** are powerful for managing complex AI tasks, they address a different set of problems than your multi-laptop approach.

  * **Software Solutions**: These tools are designed to automate and scale complex workflows. The **Claude COD Task Arrange tool**, for example, is built to manage autonomous coding agents. It automates tasks like creating pull requests, fixing linting errors, and running tests. This is a form of **agentic coding**, where the AI itself manages the development lifecycle. This is less about human-computer interaction and more about leveraging AI to do the work autonomously. These tools are valuable for large-scale projects where you need to coordinate many parallel tasks, but they introduce a new layer of abstraction and complexity. They also often require a single, powerful machine to run on.

  * **Physical Solutions**: Your approach of using multiple laptops is a form of **"manual" parallelism**. It's simple, direct, and effective for personal, interactive use cases. You are the orchestrator, and you use your physical movement (moving your chair or body) to switch contexts. This is a great solution for when you want to directly supervise or interact with each AI task, rather than letting it run in the background.

Both approaches are valid, but they serve different purposes. Your multi-laptop method prioritizes simplicity, direct control, and a clear physical separation of tasks. Software solutions prioritize automation, scalability, and the ability to run complex, interconnected workflows on a single system.

Here is a video from YouTube that discusses how to choose a computer for AI and machine learning work, which is relevant to your approach of using multiple machines for different tasks.
