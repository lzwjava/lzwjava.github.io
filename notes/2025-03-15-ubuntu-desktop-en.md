It sounds like your Ubuntu system might not have a graphical user interface (GUI) installed, which would explain why you don’t see a file browser (often called a file manager in Linux) or any kind of “finder.” This could happen if you installed a server version of Ubuntu, chose a minimal installation, or if there’s an issue preventing the GUI from loading. Don’t worry—we can fix this by installing a GUI like GNOME (Ubuntu’s default desktop environment) or another option if you prefer. Here’s how to do it step-by-step.

### Step 1: Update Your System
Before installing anything, it’s a good idea to ensure your package lists are up to date and your system is fully upgraded. Open a terminal and run these commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
This refreshes the list of available packages.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```
This updates all currently installed packages to their latest versions. If prompted, press `Y` to confirm.

### Step 2: Install the GNOME Desktop Environment
Since you mentioned wanting a GUI “like GNOME or other,” let’s start with GNOME, as it’s the default for Ubuntu Desktop and includes a file manager called Nautilus. To install it, run:

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
```
This command installs the full GNOME desktop environment, along with standard applications like a file manager, web browser, and more. The installation might take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed and system. If asked to choose a display manager (e.g., GDM or LightDM), you can usually stick with the default option (GDM for GNOME) by pressing Enter.

### Step 3: Reboot Your System
After the installation finishes, reboot your system to start the GUI:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
Once your system restarts, you should see a graphical login screen. Log in, and you’ll have a fully functional desktop with a file manager (Nautilus) that lets you browse files.

### What If It Doesn’t Work?
If you still don’t see a GUI after rebooting, it’s possible there’s an issue with the display manager or graphics drivers. You can try starting the display manager manually to test:

```bash
sudo systemctl start gdm
```
If that brings up a login screen, great! To ensure it starts automatically on every boot, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gdm
```
If the GUI still doesn’t appear, check for errors by reviewing the system logs with:

```bash
journalctl -b
```
Look for messages related to `gdm`, `Xorg`, or graphics drivers, and feel free to seek further help with those details.

### Alternative GUI Options
If you’d prefer a different GUI instead of GNOME, here are some popular alternatives:
- **KDE Plasma** (sleek and customizable):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install kubuntu-desktop
  ```
- **XFCE** (lightweight and fast):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop
  ```
- **LXDE** (very lightweight, good for older hardware):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop
  ```
After installing any of these, reboot with `sudo reboot`, and you’ll get a desktop environment with a file manager (e.g., Dolphin for KDE, Thunar for XFCE).

### Why Didn’t I Have a GUI?
You might not have seen a GUI because:
- You installed Ubuntu Server, which doesn’t include a desktop by default.
- You chose a minimal installation during setup, skipping the GUI.
- There’s a rare chance the GUI is installed but not starting due to a configuration or hardware issue.

Installing `ubuntu-desktop` as described should resolve this if it’s a missing GUI. If you suspect a problem with an existing GUI, let me know, and we can troubleshoot further!

### Summary
To install GNOME and get a file browser on your Ubuntu system:
1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`
3. `sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop`
4. `sudo reboot`

You’ll soon have a graphical interface with a file manager ready to use. Enjoy your Ubuntu desktop!
