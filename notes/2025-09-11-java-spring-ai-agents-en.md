Awesome question. Here are practical, high-leverage AI agents you can tailor for a Java/Spring monorepo (multi-module, Maven/Jetty/Liberty, JaCoCo, etc.). I’ll focus on concrete triggers, what they produce, and how to wire them up—no tables.

# Core engineering agents

**1) PR Code Reviewer (Spring-aware)**

* **Triggers:** On pull request.
* **What it does:** Reads diffs + touched Spring beans/config; flags DI issues, mis-scoped beans, missing `@Transactional`, N+1 risks with JPA, misused `@Scheduled`, thread-leaks with async, blocking calls on reactive chains.
* **Inputs:** Diff + `pom.xml` + `application*.yml` + `@Configuration` classes.
* **Outputs:** Line-comment suggestions, risk summary, quick-fix patches.

**2) Dependency & Plugin Upgrader**

* **Triggers:** Daily/weekly job.
* **What it does:** Proposes compatible version bumps for Spring Boot/Framework, Spring Data/Cloud, Jetty/Liberty, Maven plugins, checks CVEs, runs smoke build.
* **Outputs:** PRs grouped by risk (patch, minor, major), with changelog and rollback note.

**3) API Contract Guardian**

* **Triggers:** On PRs touching controllers or `openapi.yaml`.
* **What it does:** Keeps OpenAPI spec in sync with Spring MVC annotations; detects breaking changes (HTTP codes, field renames, nullable/required).
* **Outputs:** Comment with diff of API surface; optional Pact-style contract test stubs.

**4) Test Author & Flaky-Test Doctor**

* **Triggers:** On PR (low test delta) and nightly.
* **What it does:** Generates/extends JUnit 5 tests for services/controllers/repos; stabilizes flakies (time, temp dirs, concurrency), proposes deterministic patterns, isolates clock with `Clock`.
* **Outputs:** New tests, parameterization, hints to replace sleeps with Awaitility.

**5) Coverage Orchestrator (Unit+IT, multi-module)**

* **Triggers:** On CI after integration tests.
* **What it does:** Attaches JaCoCo agent to Jetty/Liberty, merges `jacoco.exec`/`jacoco-it.exec`, maps classes across modules, highlights untested critical paths.
* **Outputs:** Merged HTML/XML report; a comment listing top 10 uncovered methods per module with suggested test skeletons.

**6) Log & Incident Triage**

* **Triggers:** On failed CI jobs, or streaming from staging/prod.
* **What it does:** Clusters stack traces, correlates with last deploy, links to suspect commits; suggests quick diffs and feature flags to toggle.
* **Outputs:** Root-cause hypotheses, “next step” checklist, Grafana/ELK links.

**7) Performance Profiler Coach**

* **Triggers:** On load-test run or slow endpoint alert.
* **What it does:** Reads JFR/async-profiler output + Spring actuator metrics; spots slow `@Transactional` boundaries, N+1, heavyweight mappers, mis-sized pools.
* **Outputs:** Focused perf plan (JPA fetch graph hints, indexes, pool sizes, cache).

**8) Database Migration Assistant (Db2/MySQL/Postgres aware)**

* **Triggers:** On Flyway/Liquibase change or slow query reports.
* **What it does:** Reviews DDL for locking, adds indexes, simulates migration order; produces rollback scripts; rewrites inefficient JPQL/Criteria to SQL with hints.
* **Outputs:** Reviewed migration PR, explain-plan notes, safe rollout steps.

**9) Security & Secrets Sentinel**

* **Triggers:** On every PR and nightly scan.
* **What it does:** SAST for Spring Security misconfig, CSRF/headers, deserialization, SpEL injection; scans for secrets in YAML, properties, test fixtures.
* **Outputs:** Inline PR annotations, suggested `SecurityFilterChain` diffs.

**10) Config Drift & Profile Auditor**

* **Triggers:** On PRs touching `application*.yml`.
* **What it does:** Validates profile overlays, env var bindings, missing defaults; detects prod-only surprises (e.g., different `spring.jpa.open-in-view`).
* **Outputs:** “Effective config” preview by profile and environment.

**11) Build Cop (Maven multi-module)**

* **Triggers:** On every build.
* **What it does:** Diagnoses plugin ordering, reproducible builds, encoding warnings, test fork settings, Surefire/Failsafe handoff, module graph regressions.
* **Outputs:** Specific `pom.xml` patches and a faster build recipe.

**12) Release Notes & Changelog Writer**

* **Triggers:** On tag or release branch merge.
* **What it does:** Groups commits by conventional scope/module; pulls notable API changes & migrations; includes upgrade steps.
* **Outputs:** `CHANGELOG.md` section + GitHub Release body draft.

# Cross-cutting “glue” patterns

**Event sources:** GitHub PRs/Actions, Jenkins, Maven phases, Gradle tasks (if any), log pipelines, JFR outputs, Actuator metrics, Pact/Postman runs.
**Context packs:** Diff + touched modules, `pom.xml` trees, OpenAPI, `application*.yml`, key configs (`SecurityFilterChain`, `DataSource`, `JpaRepositories`), test reports, JaCoCo XML, profiler/flamegraphs.
**Response targets:** PR comments with code-fenced patches, status checks, auto-PRs, markdown reports stored as build artifacts.

# Minimal wiring (copy-paste friendly)

**1) GitHub Action step to prep repo context for agents**

```yaml
- name: Prepare Spring context bundle
  run: |
    mkdir -p .agent_ctx
    git diff -U0 origin/main... > .agent_ctx/diff.patch || true
    find . -name "pom.xml" -o -name "build.gradle*" > .agent_ctx/build_files.txt
    find . -name "application*.yml" -o -name "application*.properties" > .agent_ctx/configs.txt
    find . -name "openapi*.yaml" -o -name "openapi*.yml" > .agent_ctx/openapi.txt
```

**2) JaCoCo merge (unit + IT) for multi-module**

```bash
mvn -q -DskipITs=false -P it-tests verify
mvn -q org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent verify
mvn -q org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:report-aggregate
# If you collect external IT with a running Jetty/Liberty:
# java -javaagent:jacocoagent.jar=destfile=jacoco-it.exec,append=true ...
# then merge:
mvn -q org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:merge \
  -DdestFile=target/jacoco-merged.exec \
  -Dfile1=target/jacoco.exec -Dfile2=target/jacoco-it.exec
mvn -q org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:report \
  -DdataFile=target/jacoco-merged.exec
```

**3) PR comment helper (ChatOps style)**

```yaml
- name: Post agent findings
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "### API Contract Changes" > agent-comment.md
    echo "" >> agent-comment.md
    cat target/api-diff.md >> agent-comment.md || true
- uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    path: agent-comment.md
```

# What to build first (highest ROI)

1. **PR Code Review + Config Auditor**: catches 70% of common Spring mistakes early.
2. **Coverage Orchestrator**: merges unit and external IT (your case) and outputs test TODOs per module.
3. **API Contract Guardian**: prevents breaking clients; small effort, big pain avoided.
4. **Dependency Upgrader + Security Sentinel**: steady hygiene with minimal noise.

# Guardrails & quality

* **Determinism:** Agents should include rule IDs and links to the exact code lines they analyzed.
* **Change budgets:** Cap auto-edits to small patches; larger refactors become draft PRs.
* **Privacy/Access:** Restrict prod logs/DB snapshots; redact secrets before model calls.
* **Metrics:** Track MTTR (fail → fix), flaky rate, test coverage delta, perf SLIs. Use weekly agent scorecards.

# If you want, I can:

* Draft a **ready-to-drop GitHub Actions workflow** that runs “PR Code Review + API Contract Guardian + Coverage Orchestrator” using your modules and JaCoCo setup.
* Generate **starter rules** tuned to your stack (Jetty/Liberty, Db2, multi-module Maven).

Tell me your repo structure (module names) and how you currently run IT (Jetty vs Liberty), and I’ll ship the YAML + small helper scripts.
