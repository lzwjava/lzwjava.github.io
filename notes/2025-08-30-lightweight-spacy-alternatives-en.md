Got it — you’re looking for alternatives to **spaCy** that are lightweight and especially useful for tasks like **language detection** (since you’re using `langdetect` and a custom simple detector).

Here are some good options:

---

### 🔹 Language Detection–Focused Libraries

* **[langid.py](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py)**

  * Pure Python, no external dependencies.
  * Trained on 90+ languages.
  * Deterministic and lightweight.
  * Often faster and more consistent than `langdetect`.

* **[fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html)** (by Facebook/Meta AI)

  * Pretrained language ID model (`lid.176.bin`) supports 176 languages.
  * Very fast, works on short text and noisy input.
  * Needs the `fasttext` Python bindings, but still relatively lightweight compared to spaCy.

* **[polyglot](https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

  * Handles language detection, tokenization, POS tagging, NER.
  * Supports 100+ languages.
  * Depends on `pycld2` or `pyicu`, slightly heavier than `langid` but still much lighter than spaCy.

* **[cld3](https://github.com/google/cld3)** (Google’s Compact Language Detector v3)

  * Neural-network based, very accurate on short text.
  * Python bindings available (`pycld3`).
  * Tiny and efficient, but you need to install C++ extension.

### 🔹 Lightweight NLP Toolkits (General)

* **[TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/)**

  * Wraps `nltk` + `pattern`.
  * Provides language detection, sentiment, POS tagging, translation via APIs.
  * Very simple to use, good for quick scripts, but less robust than spaCy.

* **[Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)**

  * From Stanford NLP.
  * Accurate tokenization, tagging, parsing.
  * Still smaller and easier to set up than spaCy, but not as “tiny” as langid/fastText.

* **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)**

  * Classic Python NLP toolkit.
  * Many utilities but less optimized and heavier than you may want.
  * Not great for production language detection, better for teaching / prototyping.

### 🔹 For Your Use Case (Validation of Translations)

Given your pipeline (`langdetect` + rule-based checks + fallback), the best drop-in lightweight alternatives would be:

1. **langid.py** → deterministic, no external deps, works out of the box.
2. **pycld3** → very strong for short noisy text, also lightweight.
3. **fastText LID** → if you want accuracy across many languages (but larger model file).

---

👉 Recommendation:

* Replace `langdetect` with **langid.py** if you want simplicity and determinism.
* Use **pycld3** if your text is often short (like titles or snippets).
* If you care about broad coverage and don’t mind a bigger model file, **fastText** is excellent.

Do you want me to **adapt your `detect_languages_with_langdetect` function** so it can plug-and-play with `langid.py` or `pycld3` as drop-in replacements? That way you can benchmark accuracy vs. `langdetect` in your translation validator.
