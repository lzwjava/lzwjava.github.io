### Introduction to JDK 24

Java Development Kit (JDK) 24 is a feature release of the Java SE (Standard Edition) Platform, officially released on March 18, 2025, as the Reference Implementation of version 24, specified by JSR 399 in the Java Community Process. It continues Oracle’s six-month release cadence, delivering a robust set of enhancements to improve developer productivity, performance, and security. JDK 24 includes 24 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), the highest number of features since the time-based release schedule began in 2018, making it a significant milestone in Java’s evolution. It serves as a stepping stone toward JDK 25, the next Long-Term Support (LTS) release scheduled for September 2025.[](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html)[](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/)[](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-24-2025-03-18/)

### Long-Term Support (LTS) Status

JDK 24 is **not** a Long-Term Support (LTS) release. It is a short-term support release, receiving only six months of Premier-level support from Oracle, until September 2025, when it will be superseded by JDK 25. In contrast, LTS releases like JDK 21 (September 2023) and the upcoming JDK 25 (September 2025) receive at least five years of Premier support, making them preferred for enterprise stability. Oracle’s LTS cadence occurs every two years, with JDK 21 being the most recent LTS and JDK 25 set to be the next.[](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html)[](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/whats-new-java-24)[](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html)

### Release and Stability

JDK 24 is a **stable, production-ready release**, having reached General Availability (GA) on March 18, 2025. Production-ready binaries are available from Oracle under the Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions (NFTC) and the GNU General Public License (GPLv2) for OpenJDK, with other vendors’ binaries following shortly. The release includes over 3,000 bug fixes and smaller enhancements beyond the 24 JEPs, ensuring stability for general use. However, as a non-LTS release, it is primarily aimed at developers eager to test new features rather than enterprises requiring long-term stability.[](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/)[](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/18/oracle_jdk_24/)[](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/24-relnote-issues.html)
