Yes — your instinct is right. In database design, being **as strict as possible up front** usually pays off later. Let me break it down:

---

### Why Strictness Helps

* **Data Consistency:**
  Unique constraints, `NOT NULL`, and strict data types prevent bad or duplicated data from creeping in.
* **Referential Integrity:**
  Foreign keys ensure that relationships between tables remain valid — no orphaned rows, no “dangling references.”
* **Trust in Data:**
  With constraints in place, developers and analysts can rely on the database itself to enforce correctness rather than writing extra checks in every application layer.
* **Reduced Maintenance Hassle:**
  Bugs caused by inconsistent or invalid data are notoriously expensive to fix later. Constraints make those issues surface immediately instead of months later.

### When Strictness Can Be a Problem

* **Over-constraining for changing business rules:** If your business logic is still evolving, being *too* rigid may cause frequent schema changes.
* **Performance trade-offs:** In extremely high-write environments (like analytics pipelines or logging systems), strict foreign keys and unique constraints may introduce overhead.
* **Migration complexity:** Sometimes you need temporary “looseness” (e.g., during data import, integration with external APIs, or legacy migrations).

### Practical Guidelines

1. **Default to strict:** Use `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, and `CHECK` constraints by default.
2. **Always use foreign keys** unless there is a strong reason not to (like bulk ingestion speed where referential checks happen elsewhere).
3. **Use proper data types:** e.g., `DATE` instead of `VARCHAR` for dates, `BOOLEAN` instead of `INT(1)`.
4. **Think about future queries:** Ensure indexes align with your constraints and access patterns.
5. **Document exceptions:** If you relax a constraint (say, allow `NULL`), write down why.

✅ General rule: *Be as strict as the business rules allow.*
Loosen only when you have a concrete reason — and make the looseness explicit in your design notes.
