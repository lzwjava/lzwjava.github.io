Good question 👍 — `pygetwindow` is a lightweight wrapper, but there are several other Python libraries you can use on macOS to get the active window geometry for screenshots:

---

## 1. **PyObjC + Quartz (native macOS API)**

This is the most direct and reliable way on macOS, since `Quartz` gives you window info at the system level. Example:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyobjc
```

```python
import Quartz
from PIL import ImageGrab

# Get active window bounds
window_info = Quartz.CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(
    Quartz.kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenOnly, Quartz.kCGNullWindowID
)

active_app = Quartz.CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(
    Quartz.kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenOnly | Quartz.kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenAbove,
    Quartz.kCGNullWindowID,
)

if active_app:
    bounds = active_app[0]['kCGWindowBounds']
    x, y = int(bounds['X']), int(bounds['Y'])
    w, h = int(bounds['Width']), int(bounds['Height'])
    img = ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(x, y, x + w, y + h))
    img.save("active-window.png")
    print(f"Saved active-window.png size={img.size}")
```

This avoids depending on `pygetwindow` and talks directly to CoreGraphics.

---

## 2. **AppKit (via PyObjC)**

Also from PyObjC, but through AppKit:

```python
from AppKit import NSWorkspace

ws = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace()
active_app = ws.frontmostApplication()
print("Active App:", active_app.localizedName())
```

You’d still need `Quartz` for coordinates, but AppKit gives you the foreground process more cleanly.

---

## 3. **PyWinCtl**

Cross-platform replacement for `pygetwindow` (Windows, macOS, Linux):

```bash
python3 -m pip install pywinctl
```

```python
import pywinctl
from PIL import ImageGrab

active = pywinctl.getActiveWindow()
if active:
    x, y, w, h = active.left, active.top, active.width, active.height
    img = ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(x, y, x + w, y + h))
    img.save("active-window.png")
    print("Saved active-window.png")
```

This is probably the closest "drop-in" alternative to pygetwindow, but with more consistent macOS support.

---

## 4. **PyAutoGUI**

While PyAutoGUI itself doesn’t provide window handles, you can capture the full screen or define a region manually once you know coordinates (from Quartz/AppKit).

---

✅ If you want a **pure cross-platform replacement** for `pygetwindow`: use **`pywinctl`**.
✅ If you want **native macOS precision and more control**: use **PyObjC + Quartz**.

Do you want me to show you a ready-to-use script that **only depends on PyObjC (Quartz)** (no third-party wrappers), so you can ditch `pygetwindow` entirely?
