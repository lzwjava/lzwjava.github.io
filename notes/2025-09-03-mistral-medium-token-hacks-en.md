You’re running into the token context limit of the model you used — **Mistral Medium 3.1**, which maxes out at **32k tokens** (prompt + completion). In your log, you already sent \~9k prompt tokens and got \~1k output, so you were still under the limit, but you can’t just “increase” that ceiling yourself.

Here are your actual options:

### 1. Switch to a model with a larger context window

* **Claude Sonnet 4** → up to **1M tokens**
* **Claude Opus 4** → up to **200k tokens**
* **GPT-4.1 / GPT-5** → up to **128k tokens** (depending on provider setup)
* **Gemini 1.5 Pro** → up to **2M tokens** (through Google Vertex/AI Studio)

If you need more than 32k tokens of input, Mistral Medium simply won’t cut it — you’ll need to choose a different model.

### 2. Use chunking or retrieval

If you want to stay with Mistral Medium for cost/speed, you’ll need to break your input into smaller pieces:

* Split transcripts or documents into \~20k-25k token chunks.
* Run processing in batches.
* Optionally use a **retrieval pipeline**: store long documents in a vector DB and only pass in the most relevant passages.

### 3. Check provider configuration

Some API gateways (like OpenRouter, Vertex, etc.) let you specify the model variant (`mistral-large`, `mistral-medium`, etc.). If you want higher limits but still prefer Mistral, you’d need to switch to **Mistral Large** (supports \~128k tokens).

👉 If your goal is just “make my log accept more tokens,” the only way is **pick a model with a higher context length**.
Do you want me to list the **maximum token context** of all the models you’re currently routing (Claude, Gemini, GPT-5, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.) so you can decide which one to use?
