Transitioning from a full-stack development background with 10 years of experience to quantitative trading is an exciting move! Your programming skills in Java, Spring, and app development provide a solid foundation, but quantitative trading requires a blend of finance, mathematics, statistics, and advanced programming tailored to algorithmic strategies. Since you're new to this domain and aspire to reach the level of firms like D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, or legendary investors like George Soros and Ray Dalio, I'll outline a roadmap to get you started and progressively build expertise.

### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Quantitative Trading
Quantitative trading involves using mathematical models, statistical techniques, and algorithms to identify and execute trading opportunities. It’s different from traditional discretionary trading because it relies heavily on data analysis and automation.

#### What to Learn:
- **Financial Markets Basics**: Understand stocks, options, futures, forex, and how markets operate (e.g., order books, liquidity, volatility).
- **Trading Concepts**: Learn about market microstructure, risk management, portfolio optimization, and basic strategies (e.g., arbitrage, trend-following, mean reversion).
- **Key Tools**: Familiarize yourself with trading APIs (like the TigerOpen one you’re using), backtesting, and execution systems.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *"Quantitative Trading" by Ernest P. Chan* - A beginner-friendly intro to building trading systems.
  - *"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John C. Hull* - For understanding financial instruments.
- **Online Courses**:
  - Coursera: *Financial Markets* by Yale University (Robert Shiller).
  - Udemy: *Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Analysis Using Python* by Mayank Rasu.

#### Action:
- Since you’ve already used the TigerOpen API, experiment with pulling historical data and placing mock trades to understand how APIs connect to markets.

### Step 2: Build Core Quantitative Skills
Quantitative trading relies heavily on mathematics and statistics, which you’ll need to master.

#### What to Learn:
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability theory.
- **Statistics**: Time-series analysis, regression, hypothesis testing, stochastic processes.
- **Programming**: Shift focus to Python (industry standard for quant trading) and libraries like NumPy, pandas, SciPy, and matplotlib.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *"Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney* - Master Python for data manipulation.
  - *"Introduction to Probability" by Joseph K. Blitzstein* - Probability basics.
- **Courses**:
  - Khan Academy: Probability and Statistics (free).
  - edX: *Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials* by MIT.
- **Practice**:
  - Use platforms like Quantopian (now QuantRocket or Backtrader) to backtest simple strategies with Python.

#### Action:
- Write a basic mean-reversion strategy (e.g., buy when price drops below a moving average, sell when it rises above) using TigerOpen’s historical data and backtest it.

### Step 3: Dive into Algorithmic Trading
Now, focus on designing and implementing trading algorithms.

#### What to Learn:
- **Algorithm Types**: Statistical arbitrage, momentum, market-making, high-frequency trading (HFT).
- **Backtesting**: Avoid pitfalls like overfitting, look-ahead bias, and survivorship bias.
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, stop-losses, Value-at-Risk (VaR).

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *"Algorithmic Trading: Winning Strategies and Their Rationale" by Ernest P. Chan* - Practical strategies.
  - *"Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos López de Prado* - Cutting-edge techniques.
- **Platforms**:
  - QuantConnect: Open-source, cloud-based backtesting with Python/C#.
  - Interactive Brokers API: Alternative to TigerOpen for real-world trading practice.

#### Action:
- Convert your Java skills to Python (syntax is simpler, focus on libraries). Build a momentum strategy using TigerOpen and test it with historical data.

### Step 4: Incorporate GPU and Deep Learning
Top firms like D.E. Shaw and Bridgewater use advanced tech like GPUs and deep learning for predictive modeling and optimization.

#### What to Learn:
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised (regression, classification), unsupervised (clustering), and reinforcement learning.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, LSTMs, GANs for time-series prediction.
- **GPU Programming**: CUDA, TensorFlow/PyTorch with GPU acceleration.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow* - Theoretical foundation.
  - *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron* - Practical ML/DL.
- **Courses**:
  - Coursera: *Deep Learning Specialization* by Andrew Ng.
  - Fast.ai: Free practical deep learning course.
- **Tools**:
  - Learn PyTorch or TensorFlow (PyTorch is more quant-friendly).
  - Set up a local GPU environment (e.g., NVIDIA GPU with CUDA).

#### Action:
- Train a simple LSTM model to predict stock prices using historical TigerOpen data. Compare its performance to your earlier statistical models.

### Step 5: Emulate Top Firms and Investors
To reach the level of D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, Soros, or Dalio, you’ll need a mix of technical prowess, market intuition, and strategic thinking.

#### Key Insights:
- **D.E. Shaw**: Known for high-frequency trading and cutting-edge ML. Focus on low-latency systems (C++/Python) and statistical arbitrage.
- **Bridgewater**: Emphasizes systematic macro trading and risk parity. Study portfolio theory and economic cycles.
- **George Soros**: Master of reflexivity—understanding market psychology and macroeconomic trends.
- **Ray Dalio**: Principles-based investing and diversification. Learn his “All Weather” portfolio approach.

#### Resources:
- **Books**:
  - *"The Alchemy of Finance" by George Soros* - Reflexivity and macro trading.
  - *"Principles" by Ray Dalio* - Decision-making frameworks.
- **Research Papers**: Search arXiv for ML in finance papers (e.g., López de Prado’s work).
- **X and Web**: Follow quant traders on X (e.g., @quantian1, @KrisAbdelmessih) for insights.

#### Action:
- Simulate a macro strategy (e.g., trade based on interest rate changes) and optimize it with ML.

### Roadmap Summary
1. **Months 1-3**: Learn finance basics, Python, and simple strategies. Backtest with TigerOpen.
2. **Months 4-6**: Master stats, time-series analysis, and algorithmic trading. Build 2-3 strategies.
3. **Months 7-12**: Dive into ML/DL, use GPUs, and refine strategies with real-time data.
4. **Year 2**: Focus on latency (C++ if HFT interests you), portfolio management, and macro insights.
5. **Year 3+**: Develop a unique edge (e.g., novel data source, ML model) and test with live capital.

### Practical Tips
- **Start Small**: Use paper trading (simulated trades) before risking real money.
- **Community**: Join forums like QuantConnect, EliteTrader, or Reddit’s r/algotrading.
- **Data**: Explore free sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) or paid ones (Bloomberg, Refinitiv).
- **Hardware**: Invest in a decent GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060) for DL experiments.

With your programming experience, you’re already ahead of many beginners. Focus on bridging the finance and math gaps, and iteratively build complexity. Reaching D.E. Shaw or Bridgewater’s level takes years, but consistent learning and experimentation will get you there. What’s your next step—deepening Python skills or exploring a specific strategy?
