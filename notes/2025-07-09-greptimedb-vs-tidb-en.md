Let me search for more specific technical issues and limitations with GreptimeDB.GreptimeDB is in a much better position than TiDB, but it does have some potential challenges:

## GreptimeDB's Advantages

**Focused Problem Domain**: Unlike TiDB trying to be a general-purpose distributed SQL database, GreptimeDB specifically targets time-series and observability data, which is a clearer use case with growing demand.

**Performance Results**: GreptimeDB demonstrates significant query performance advantages over InfluxDB, being 2 to 11 times faster for queries involving 12 hours of data and complex operations like double-groupby and sorting scenarios.

**Modern Architecture**: Built in Rust with cloud-native design principles, it's positioned well for modern infrastructure needs.

## Potential Issues

**Market Competition**: The time-series database space is crowded with established players like InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, and cloud-native solutions from major providers.

**Ecosystem Maturity**: While the documentation mentions "no strict limitations" for table counts, it acknowledges that many primary key columns can impact write performance, suggesting there are still performance considerations to work through.

**Early Stage**: GreptimeDB has been growing steadily since its open-source release on November 15, 2022, making it relatively young compared to established alternatives.

## Key Differences from TiDB

1. **Specific Use Case**: Time-series data has different patterns and requirements than general OLTP workloads
2. **Less Complexity**: Doesn't need the same level of distributed transaction coordination that dooms TiDB
3. **Performance Focus**: The benchmarks show it's actually competitive or better than established solutions

## Verdict

GreptimeDB doesn't have the same "fatal problems" as TiDB because:
- It's solving a specific problem rather than trying to be everything to everyone
- Time-series workloads are more naturally suited to distributed architectures
- It's showing concrete performance advantages in benchmarks

However, success isn't guaranteed. It needs to prove long-term reliability, build ecosystem adoption, and compete against well-funded incumbents. The technical foundation seems solid, but market success depends on execution and timing.
