The error indicates that the CUDA toolkit is not installed or properly configured, as the compiler cannot find `cuda.h`. Additionally, your code is a CUDA source file (`.cu`) but you're trying to compile it with `gcc`, which is not suitable for CUDA code. You need to use `nvcc`, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler. Here's how to fix the issue:

### Steps to Fix

1. **Install CUDA Toolkit**:
   - Ensure the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit is installed on your system. You can download it from the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Linux in this case, based on the prompt).
   - After installation, verify it by running:
     ```bash
     nvcc --version
     ```
     This should display the CUDA version if installed correctly.

2. **Use `nvcc` to Compile**:
   - Since your file is a CUDA source file (`.cu`), compile it with `nvcc` instead of `gcc`. Replace:
     ```bash
     gcc scripts/benchmark/cudamark.c
     ```
     with:
     ```bash
     nvcc scripts/benchmark/cudamark.cu
     ```
   - Note: Ensure the file extension matches your actual file (`.cu` in the code you provided, not `.c` as in the error).

3. **Set Up CUDA Environment**:
   - Ensure the CUDA toolkit paths are included in your environment. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file:
     ```bash
     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```
     Then, source the file:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

4. **Link Thrust Library**:
   - Your code uses Thrust, which is part of the CUDA toolkit, so no additional libraries need to be linked explicitly. However, ensure you have a compatible CUDA version (Thrust is included in CUDA 7.0 and later).

5. **Fix Code Issues**:
   - The code references `thread_counts` but does not use it in the `benchmark` function. The `parallel_sort_gpu` function uses Thrust, which manages parallelism internally, so the `thread_counts` loop in `main` is misleading. If you intended to benchmark different thread configurations, Thrust's sort does not allow direct thread count control. You might want to clarify this logic or remove the unused `thread_counts`.
   - For clarity, you could modify the code to benchmark the same list size multiple times to average out timing variations:

     ```cuda
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <cuda.h>
     #include <thrust/device_vector.h>
     #include <thrust/sort.h>
     #include <time.h>

     void parallel_sort_gpu(int *arr, int n) {
         thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(arr, arr + n);
         thrust::sort(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end());
         thrust::copy(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end(), arr);
     }

     double benchmark(int list_size) {
         int *arr = (int*)malloc(list_size * sizeof(int));
         for (int i = 0; i < list_size; ++i) {
             arr[i] = rand() % 1000001;
         }

         clock_t start = clock();
         parallel_sort_gpu(arr, list_size);
         clock_t end = clock();

         free(arr);
         return (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
     }

     int main() {
         int list_size = 50000000;
         int num_runs = 8; // Number of runs to average

         printf("Run,TimeTakenSeconds\n");
         for (int i = 0; i < num_runs; ++i) {
             double t = benchmark(list_size);
             printf("%d,%.6f\n", i + 1, t);
         }
         return 0;
     }
     ```

6. **Compile the Updated Code**:
   - Save the code as `cudamark.cu` and compile it:
     ```bash
     nvcc -o cudamark scripts/benchmark/cudamark.cu
     ```
   - If you encounter linker errors, ensure the CUDA libraries are accessible (see step 3).

7. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the compiled binary:
     ```bash
     ./cudamark
     ```

8. **Additional Notes**:
   - **File Extension**: Ensure the file has a `.cu` extension, as CUDA files require this for `nvcc` to process them correctly.
   - **GPU Availability**: Ensure you have a CUDA-capable GPU and the correct drivers installed. Check with:
     ```bash
     nvidia-smi
     ```
   - **Thrust and CUDA Version**: Verify that your CUDA version supports Thrust. CUDA 11.x or later is recommended for modern Thrust features.
   - **Timing Accuracy**: The `clock()` function measures CPU time, not GPU execution time. For more accurate GPU timing, consider using CUDA events:
     ```cuda
     cudaEvent_t start, stop;
     cudaEventCreate(&start);
     cudaEventCreate(&stop);
     cudaEventRecord(start);
     parallel_sort_gpu(arr, list_size);
     cudaEventRecord(stop);
     cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
     float milliseconds = 0;
     cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
     return milliseconds / 1000.0; // Convert to seconds
     ```

9. **If Errors Persist**:
   - If `cuda.h` is still not found, verify the CUDA toolkit installation path (e.g., `/usr/local/cuda/include`). You may need to specify the include path explicitly:
     ```bash
     nvcc -I/usr/local/cuda/include -o cudamark scripts/benchmark/cudamark.cu
     ```
   - Ensure the file path `scripts/benchmark/cudamark.cu` is correct relative to your current directory.

### Updated Compilation Command
```bash
nvcc -o cudamark scripts/benchmark/cudamark.cu
```

### Expected Output
After fixing the issues, running `./cudamark` should produce output like:
```
Run,TimeTakenSeconds
1,0.123456
2,0.124567
...
```
