The NVIDIA A800 is a professional-grade graphics processing unit (GPU) developed by NVIDIA, primarily designed for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and workstation workflows. It is based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture and uses the GA100 graphics processor, manufactured on a 7nm process. The A800 was introduced in November 2022 as a variant of the NVIDIA A100 GPU, specifically tailored to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips to certain regions, such as China. The key difference from the A100 is a reduced NVLink interconnect speed (400 GB/s on the A800 versus 600 GB/s on the A100), which impacts multi-GPU scaling but maintains similar core performance in single-GPU tasks.

### Key Specifications (for the A800 PCIe 40GB variant, as an example):
- **CUDA Cores**: 6,912
- **Tensor Cores**: 432 (third-generation)
- **Memory**: 40 GB HBM2 (high-bandwidth memory); some variants offer 80 GB
- **Memory Bandwidth**: Up to 1.55 TB/s
- **Performance**:
  - Single-precision (FP32): Up to 19.5 TFLOPS
  - Double-precision (FP64): Up to 9.7 TFLOPS
  - Tensor performance (TF32): Up to 312 TFLOPS
- **Interface**: PCIe 4.0 x16
- **Power Consumption**: Around 250-300W TDP (thermal design power)
- **Form Factor**: Available in passive or active cooling versions for servers and workstations

The A800 excels in accelerating demanding tasks like machine learning training, inference, scientific simulations, and visualization. In benchmarks, its performance is often within 70-100% of the A100, depending on the workload—it's nearly identical in single-precision and double-precision compute but lags in scenarios requiring high-speed multi-GPU communication due to the throttled NVLink.

Variants include the A800 40GB Active (for workstations with active cooling) and server-oriented models like the A800 PCIe 80GB. It's not intended for consumer gaming but for enterprise and professional use.
