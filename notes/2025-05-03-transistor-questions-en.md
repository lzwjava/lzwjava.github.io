In a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the behavior of currents and voltages between the base-emitter (BE) and collector-emitter (CE) junctions is governed by the transistor's physics and its operational design. Let’s break down your questions systematically:

### 1. **Why is there a small voltage (≈0.7V) across the base-emitter junction?**
The base-emitter junction of a BJT behaves like a diode. For a silicon-based BJT (most common), the forward voltage drop across this junction is typically around **0.7V** when it is forward-biased (i.e., when the transistor is in the active or saturation region). This voltage is determined by the material properties of the silicon PN junction, specifically the energy required to overcome the potential barrier for current to flow. For germanium BJTs, this voltage is lower, around 0.3V, but silicon is far more common.

- **Why 0.7V?** This is the voltage needed to forward-bias the BE junction, allowing a small base current (\\(I_B\\)) to flow. The exponential relationship between voltage and current in a diode means that a small increase in voltage beyond 0.7V causes a large increase in current, but 0.7V is the typical operating point for silicon.

### 2. **Why is the current between base and emitter small, while the collector-emitter current is much larger?**
The BJT is designed to amplify current. The small base current (\\(I_B\\)) controls a much larger collector current (\\(I_C\\)). This is due to the **current gain** (\\(\beta\\)) of the transistor, which is typically in the range of 20–1000 for most BJTs.

- **How it works:**
  - The base-emitter junction is forward-biased, allowing a small base current (\\(I_B\\)) to flow.
  - This small current injects charge carriers (electrons for NPN, holes for PNP) into the base region.
  - The base is very thin and lightly doped, so most of these carriers are swept into the collector due to the reverse-biased collector-base junction.
  - The collector current (\\(I_C\\)) is approximately \\(\beta \cdot I_B\\), making it much larger than \\(I_B\\).
  - The emitter current (\\(I_E\\)) is the sum of \\(I_B\\) and \\(I_C\\), so \\(I_E \approx I_C\\) since \\(I_B\\) is small.

This amplification is the core principle of BJT operation in the active region. The small base current acts as a "control signal" for the much larger collector-emitter current.

### 3. **Why not reverse? (Why isn’t the base-emitter current large and the collector-emitter current small?)**
The transistor’s structure and doping prevent this:

- **Structural design**: The base is intentionally thin and lightly doped compared to the emitter and collector. This ensures that most carriers injected from the emitter into the base are collected by the collector, rather than staying in the base or causing a large base current.
- **Biasing**: The base-emitter junction is forward-biased (low resistance, small voltage drop), while the collector-base junction is reverse-biased (high resistance, larger voltage drop). This biasing scheme ensures that the collector current dominates.
- **Current gain (\\(\beta\\))**: The transistor is engineered to have a high \\(\beta\\), meaning the collector current is a multiple of the base current. Reversing this would defeat the purpose of the transistor as an amplifier or switch.

If the roles were reversed (large base current, small collector current), the transistor would not function as an effective amplifier or switch, and the design would be inefficient.

### 4. **Could the base-emitter voltage be 10V?**
In normal operation, the base-emitter voltage cannot be as high as **10V** without damaging the transistor:

- **Breakdown**: Applying a high voltage (e.g., 10V) across the base-emitter junction would likely exceed the junction’s breakdown voltage or cause excessive current, leading to thermal runaway or permanent damage to the transistor.
- **Diode behavior**: The BE junction behaves like a diode, so the voltage across it is clamped to around 0.7V (for silicon) in forward bias. Increasing the voltage slightly (e.g., to 0.8V or 0.9V) causes a massive increase in base current due to the exponential relationship, but practical circuits limit this with resistors or other components.
- **Circuit design**: In real circuits, the base is driven by a controlled voltage or current source (e.g., through a resistor or signal). The circuit is designed to keep \\(V_{BE}\\) around 0.7V in active mode. A 10V input would require a specific fault condition or misdesign.

### 5. **Could the base and emitter have a large voltage like the collector-emitter?**
The collector-emitter voltage (\\(V_{CE}\\)) can be much larger (e.g., 10V or more, depending on the transistor’s rating) because the collector-base junction is reverse-biased, and the collector is designed to handle higher voltages. The base-emitter junction, however, is forward-biased and operates at a low voltage (≈0.7V) due to its diode-like behavior.

- **Why not large \\(V_{BE}\\)?** The BE junction is not designed to withstand large voltages. Most BJTs have a maximum reverse \\(V_{BE}\\) rating of 5–7V, and exceeding this can cause breakdown or damage. Forward voltages much above 0.7V lead to excessive current, not a stable high-voltage state.
- **Collector-emitter role**: The collector-emitter path is meant to handle the main power or signal current, so it’s designed for larger voltages and currents, limited by the transistor’s maximum ratings (e.g., \\(V_{CE(max)}\\), often 30–100V or more).

### Summary
- The **0.7V** across the base-emitter junction is due to the silicon diode-like behavior of the junction, required to forward-bias it.
- The **small base current** controls a **large collector current** due to the transistor’s current gain (\\(\beta\\)) and structural design (thin base, doping differences).
- The currents cannot be reversed (large base, small collector) because of the transistor’s purposeful design for amplification.
- The base-emitter voltage cannot be 10V in normal operation, as it would damage the transistor or require a fault condition. The collector-emitter path is designed for larger voltages, not the base-emitter.
