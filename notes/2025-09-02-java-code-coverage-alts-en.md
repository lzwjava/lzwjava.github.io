Besides **JaCoCo**, there are several other code coverage tools and plugins you can consider in the Java ecosystem, depending on your build system and integration needs:

### 1. **Cobertura**

* One of the older Java code coverage frameworks.
* Works by instrumenting bytecode.
* Integrates with Maven, Ant, and Gradle.
* Not as actively maintained as JaCoCo, but still used in some legacy systems.

### 2. **Clover (by Atlassian)**

* Commercial tool (though older versions are open-sourced).
* Provides detailed coverage reports, including branch coverage, test optimization (running only relevant tests), and historical data.
* Works well with large enterprise projects.

### 3. **OpenClover** (community fork of Clover)

* Open-source continuation of Clover after Atlassian stopped active development.
* Similar feature set to Clover, including per-test coverage and advanced reporting.

### 4. **Pitest (Mutation Testing with Coverage)**

* Primarily a **mutation testing** tool, but it also generates coverage reports as part of mutation analysis.
* Provides stronger guarantees about test quality than simple line/branch coverage.
* Integrates with Maven/Gradle easily.

### 5. **EMMA**

* Lightweight coverage tool for Java.
* Mostly considered legacy now, but was widely used before JaCoCo gained popularity.
* Some projects still keep it around for compatibility reasons.

### 6. **TestNG / JUnit + Build Tool Integrations**

* While not standalone coverage tools, many modern build setups use **Maven Surefire**, **Failsafe**, or **Gradle test plugins** together with JaCoCo, Cobertura, or Pitest to integrate coverage directly into test pipelines.

👉 In practice, most modern teams use **JaCoCo** (best maintained, widely supported), but if you want alternatives, **OpenClover** and **Pitest** are worth serious consideration, especially if you want *beyond coverage* insights into test effectiveness.

Do you want me to also explain which of these integrate best with **Jenkins / SonarQube pipelines** (common in enterprise Java)?
