In LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Copilot API, Anthropic, etc.), **temperature** is a parameter that controls how *random* or *deterministic* the model’s output is.

---

### What Temperature Does

* **Low temperature (close to 0):**
  The model becomes deterministic, always choosing the most likely next token.
  Example: If you ask for a definition, it will give the most standard/expected answer every time.

* **High temperature (closer to 1 or above):**
  The model samples more freely, exploring less likely tokens. This increases variety, creativity, and unpredictability.
  Example: For brainstorming, storytelling, or generating code variations, a higher temperature may be better.

---

### What “0.7” Means

* `temperature = 0.7` is a **moderate balance**.

  * It allows some randomness and diversity.
  * The model will not be as rigid as `0`, but not as “wild” as `1.2`.
  * This is why **0.7 is often used as the default** in many APIs, including Copilot-like systems—it gives creative but still reliable results.

### How to Use It

In most APIs, you pass it as a parameter in the request. For example:

**OpenAI API (chat completion):**

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about a dragon and a robot."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

**GitHub Copilot API:**
The parameter works similarly. Copilot uses temperature internally to decide between more literal completions vs. more exploratory suggestions. Most IDE integrations set it around `0.7`, but some contexts (like code completion) may use lower values for stability.

✅ **Rule of thumb:**

* **0–0.3** → Deterministic, factual, predictable. Good for math, API docs, config, unit tests.
* **0.4–0.7** → Balanced, natural writing, standard coding. Good default for most cases.
* **0.8–1.2** → Creative, exploratory, risk-taking. Good for brainstorming, stories, poetry.

Do you want me to also show you how **temperature interacts with `top_p` (nucleus sampling)**, since both are often available in Copilot/LLM APIs?
