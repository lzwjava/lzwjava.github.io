Yes — that’s very likely the reason.

When you write:

```scss
@import "jekyll-theme-cayman";
```

you’re not just pulling in some local SCSS — you’re importing the entire **theme’s stylesheet**, which itself contains (or links to) the Google Fonts import. Cayman uses **Open Sans** as its default font, and it pulls it from `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700&display=swap`.

So the flow looks like this:

1. Your SCSS says `@import "jekyll-theme-cayman";`.
2. Jekyll expands that into the theme’s `_sass` files.
3. Inside Cayman’s SCSS, there’s a line like:

   ```scss
   @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700&display=swap");
   ```
4. That’s the network request you’re seeing in DevTools.

### How to remove or override

* **Override the font import**: Copy the theme’s main SCSS into your project (e.g. `assets/css/style.scss`), delete the Google Fonts line, and tell Jekyll not to import it.

* **Just override the font family**: Keep the rest of Cayman but force a system font stack in your own CSS:

  ```css
  html, body {
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Ubuntu,
                 "Helvetica Neue", Arial, "Noto Sans", sans-serif;
  }
  ```

  Even if the Google Fonts request happens, the browser won’t use it.

* **Self-host Open Sans**: If you like Open Sans but don’t want the external call, download the font files and define them with `@font-face` in your own CSS, then remove Cayman’s `@import url(...)`.
