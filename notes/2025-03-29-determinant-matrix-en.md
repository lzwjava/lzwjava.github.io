If the **determinant of matrix \\( A \\) is zero**, the system **may** have infinitely many solutions because it indicates that the matrix is **singular** (non-invertible), meaning its rows or columns are linearly dependent. Let's explore why this leads to infinite solutions.

## **1. Determinant and Rank**
- The **determinant of a square matrix \\( A \\)** tells us whether the matrix is invertible.
  - If \\( \det(A) \neq 0 \\), the matrix is **invertible**, and the system has a **unique solution**.
  - If \\( \det(A) = 0 \\), the matrix is **singular** (non-invertible), meaning the system has **either no solution or infinitely many solutions**.

- The **rank** of a matrix is the number of **linearly independent rows** or **columns**.
  - If the number of nonzero rows (rank) is **less than the number of variables**, we get **free variables**, leading to **infinitely many solutions**.

## **2. Why Infinite Solutions?**
### **Case: Homogeneous System \\( A\mathbf{x} = 0 \\)**
- A homogeneous system always has the **trivial solution** \\( \mathbf{x} = 0 \\).
- If \\( \det(A) = 0 \\), it means that at least one row is dependent on another.
- This means at least **one free variable** exists, allowing an infinite number of solutions.

**Example:**  
\\[
\begin{aligned}
x + y + z &= 0 \\
2x + 2y + 2z &= 0
\end{aligned}
\\]
- The second equation is just **twice** the first one → **only one independent equation**.
- We have **three variables but one independent equation**, so we have **free variables** → infinitely many solutions.

### **Case: Non-Homogeneous System \\( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \\)**
- If \\( \det(A) = 0 \\), the system is **either inconsistent (no solution) or has infinitely many solutions**.
- The system has **infinitely many solutions** when the number of independent equations is **less than the number of variables**.

**Example:**  
\\[
\begin{aligned}
x + y + z &= 5 \\
2x + 2y + 2z &= 10
\end{aligned}
\\]
- The second equation is just **twice** the first one.
- One independent equation with **three variables** → **infinitely many solutions** (parametric solution form).

---

## **Conclusion**
- If \\( \det(A) = 0 \\), at least one row is dependent, meaning we have **free variables**.
- Free variables allow for an **infinite number of solutions** in both homogeneous and some non-homogeneous cases.
- If \\( A \\) is singular and the system is inconsistent (e.g., conflicting equations like \\( x + y = 2 \\) and \\( x + y = 3 \\)), there is **no solution** instead of infinite solutions.
