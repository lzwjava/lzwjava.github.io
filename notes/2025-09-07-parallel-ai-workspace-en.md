Great — let me outline a practical way you could build a **parallel AI workspace** for yourself. I’ll go from simplest to most advanced, so you can pick what fits your style and resources.

---

## 1. Multi-Instance on a Single Machine

This is the entry-level approach:

* **Browser Tabs**: Open multiple Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Codex tabs, each dedicated to a different task (e.g., one for coding, one for writing, one for debugging logs).
* **Desktop Apps**: Some LLMs (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, Windsurf, etc.) let you run multiple sessions at once.
* **CLI Tools**: Run AI clients in different terminals — useful for scripting, quick Q\&A, or batch prompts.

💡 Advantage: no extra hardware needed.
⚠️ Limitation: heavy context switching, one machine’s CPU/memory limits.

---

## 2. Multi-Screen + Multi-Task Setup

If you already have **dual or triple monitors**, you can dedicate each screen to one “AI worker.”

* Left screen: AI reviewing your code.
* Center: your editor/IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.).
* Right: AI summarizing research papers or running CLI agents.
  You can even keep **persistent sessions** (Claude Projects, ChatGPT custom GPTs, Gemini Workspaces) for ongoing tasks.

💡 Advantage: visually organized parallel work.
⚠️ Limitation: still bottlenecked by one computer.

---

## 3. Multi-Machine Setup (Laptops/Desktops)

This is what you originally imagined: running different AI “stations.”

* **Laptop A**: coding/debugging with Claude Code or Cursor IDE.
* **Laptop B**: research/doc summarization.
* **Laptop C**: API calls, experiments, automation.
  Sync them with GitHub/Git, or remote file sharing (e.g., VSCode Remote SSH).

💡 Advantage: true parallelism, sessions never clash.
⚠️ Limitation: expensive, more maintenance.

---

## 4. Cloud & Orchestrator Approach (Highly Scalable)

Instead of many laptops, you can scale in the cloud:

* **Run parallel AI jobs** using scripts (Python, Node.js, Go) via APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral).
* **Agent frameworks**:

  * **LangChain / LlamaIndex** for pipelines.
  * **AutoGen** (Microsoft) for multi-agent conversations.
  * **Custom router** (like you already experimented with for GPT/Claude/Gemini routing).
* **Work distribution**: Treat each AI as a “worker thread” in a task queue (like Celery, Airflow, or simple asyncio).

💡 Advantage: infinitely scalable, cheaper than buying laptops.
⚠️ Limitation: requires some setup and cloud costs.

---

## 5. Hybrid Workspace (Best of Both Worlds)

What I recommend for you (since you’re technical and already juggling multiple models):

1. **Local multi-instance**: Use browser tabs + CLI tools for lightweight tasks.
2. **One powerful laptop/desktop**: As your “main cockpit.”
3. **Cloud agents**: Offload parallelizable tasks (batch doc summarization, running models, background coding) to a cloud orchestrator.
4. **Dashboard/Router**: Build a small web dashboard (or terminal TUI) that shows which “AI worker” is running what, so you don’t lose track.

---

🚀 With this setup, you’d have a **fleet of AI assistants**, some local (chat-like, interactive) and some cloud-based (batch, parallel), all coordinated under your control. It’s like having a small company of “AI interns” you can assign tasks to.

Do you want me to **sketch an architecture diagram** (showing how laptops, APIs, and orchestrator connect) or give you a **Python starter script** for running parallel AI tasks?
