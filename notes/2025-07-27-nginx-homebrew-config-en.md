For Nginx installed via Homebrew on macOS (as indicated by the binary path `/opt/homebrew/bin/nginx`), the main configuration file is typically located at:

```
/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

This directory also contains other related files, such as server blocks in a `servers/` subdirectory (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/`).

To confirm the exact config file path used by your Nginx instance, run the following command in your terminal:

```
nginx -t
```

This will test the configuration and output the path to the `nginx.conf` file it's using. Alternatively, use `nginx -V` to see compile-time details, including the config path prefix.

If you're on an older Intel-based Mac where Homebrew installs to `/usr/local` instead, the path would be `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, but your provided binary path confirms the `/opt/homebrew` location.
