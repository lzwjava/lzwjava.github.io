The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python is a mutex (lock) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously in a single process. It’s a mechanism used in CPython (the standard Python implementation) to ensure thread safety by allowing only one thread to execute Python code at a time, even on multi-core systems.

### Key Points about the GIL:
- **Purpose**: The GIL prevents race conditions and ensures thread-safe memory management for Python objects, simplifying the implementation of CPython.
- **Impact**: It limits true parallelism in multi-threaded Python programs, as only one thread can execute Python code at a time, even on multi-core CPUs. This makes Python less efficient for CPU-bound tasks in multi-threaded applications.
- **Workarounds**:
  - Use **multiprocessing** instead of threading to bypass the GIL, as each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.
  - Use libraries like `NumPy` or `Cython`, which can release the GIL for specific operations.
  - For I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network or file operations), threading can still be effective since the GIL is released during I/O waits.
- **Relevance**: The GIL is specific to CPython and doesn’t exist in all Python implementations (e.g., Jython or IronPython). Efforts to remove or mitigate the GIL in CPython (e.g., "No-GIL" Python) are ongoing but not yet standard as of June 2025.

### Example Impact:
```python
import threading

def cpu_bound_task():
    count = 0
    for _ in range(10**7):
        count += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=cpu_bound_task) for _ in range(4)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```
In this example, the GIL forces the threads to run sequentially, not leveraging multiple CPU cores, which limits performance for CPU-bound tasks.
