### Key Points
- It seems likely that Portkey is a suitable platform for using your own AI API keys with a unified interface, though it has a subscription fee, which may not align with your preference for pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Research suggests OpenRouter offers pay-per-token usage without a subscription, but it doesn't allow connecting your own API keys, which might not meet your needs.
- The evidence leans toward there being limited platforms that perfectly fit your criteria of using your own API keys with pay-as-you-go pricing based on token usage and no subscription fee, potentially requiring a trade-off.

### Platform Recommendation
After evaluating your needs, Portkey ([Portkey AI](https://portkey.ai/)) appears to be the closest match. It allows you to connect your own API keys for various AI models, providing a unified interface for management. However, it operates on a subscription-based model (e.g., $49/month for the Pro plan), which means you’d pay a fixed fee to use the platform, in addition to paying the AI providers directly through your keys for token usage. This might not fully align with your desire to avoid subscription fees like $20/month, but it offers advanced features like observability and prompt management that could be valuable.

If avoiding subscription fees is critical and you’re willing to forgo using your own API keys, OpenRouter ([OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) is another option. It charges $0.0001 per token after a free tier of 1000 tokens per month, with no subscription fee, but you’d use their API instead of your own keys, meaning you pay them directly for model usage.

### Unexpected Detail
An unexpected finding is that many platforms, like OpenRouter, provide their own access to AI models, requiring users to pay through the platform rather than using personal API keys, which might limit your control over costs and data.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of AI Platforms for API Key Integration and Pricing Models

This analysis explores platforms that allow users to connect their own AI API keys and offer pay-as-you-go pricing based on token usage, without a subscription fee, as an alternative to platforms like ChatBoxAI and OpenWebUI. The research, conducted as of 02:42 AM PDT on Friday, March 14, 2025, aims to address the user’s specific needs while considering the complexities of platform pricing and functionality.

#### Background and User Requirements
The user has multiple API keys for various AI platforms and seeks a platform that:
- Allows connection of their own API keys for a unified interface.
- Offers pay-as-you-go pricing based on token usage, avoiding subscription fees like $20/month.
- Provides a better user interface (UI) than ChatBoxAI, which they found poor, and potentially includes Mistral integration.

Given these requirements, the analysis focuses on identifying platforms that meet these criteria, understanding their pricing models, and evaluating their UI and integration capabilities.

#### Platform Evaluation

##### ChatBoxAI and OpenWebUI Context
- **ChatBoxAI** ([ChatBox AI](https://chatboxai.app/en)) is a desktop client for AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and others, allowing users to connect their own API keys. It has a subscription model for its AI service, which may include a $20/month fee, and supports Mistral through integrations, contrary to the user’s mention of lacking Mistral integration. Its UI is noted as poor by the user.
- **OpenWebUI** ([Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/)) is an open-source, self-hosted interface for AI models, supporting various LLM runners like Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs. It allows users to connect their own API keys and is free, with no subscription fee, fitting the pay-as-you-go model through provider costs. However, the user seeks alternatives to this.

##### Candidate Platforms
Several platforms were evaluated, focusing on their ability to handle user-provided API keys and pricing models. The key findings are summarized below:

| Platform      | Allows Own API Keys | Pricing Model                     | Mistral Integration | UI Notes                          |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Portkey       | Yes                 | Subscription-based (e.g., $49/mo) | Yes                 | Web-based, noted for ease of use  |
| OpenRouter    | No                  | Pay-per-token ($0.0001/token after 1000 free) | Yes | Web-based, simple interface       |
| Unify.ai      | Potentially (BYOM)  | Not clear, likely subscription    | Yes                 | Focused on workflows, less UI-centric |
| LiteLLM       | Yes                 | Free (open-source)                | Yes                 | API layer, no user-facing UI      |

- **Portkey** ([Portkey AI](https://portkey.ai/)): This platform allows users to connect their own API keys for over 250 LLMs, including Mistral, through its AI Gateway. It provides a unified interface with features like observability, prompt management, and model fallbacks. Pricing is subscription-based, with plans like a free Starter tier, $49/month Pro tier, and custom Business pricing. Users pay Portkey for platform access and the providers directly through their keys for model usage, which may not align with avoiding subscription fees. User reviews highlight its ease of use and comprehensive features, suggesting a potentially better UI than ChatBoxAI’s desktop client.
  
- **OpenRouter** ([OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)): This platform offers a unified API for multiple LLMs, with pay-per-token pricing ($0.0001/token after 1000 free tokens monthly, no subscription fee). However, it does not allow users to connect their own API keys; instead, users use OpenRouter’s API, paying them directly for model usage. It supports Mistral and has a web-based interface noted for simplicity, potentially offering a better UI than ChatBoxAI. This fits the pay-as-you-go model but doesn’t meet the requirement of using personal API keys.

- **Unify.ai** ([Unify: Build AI Your Way](https://unify.ai/)): This platform focuses on building AI workflows and mentions “Bring Your Own Model” (BYOM), suggesting potential support for user-provided models. However, its pricing and UI are less clear, and it seems more developer-oriented, possibly with subscription-based costs. It supports Mistral, but its fit for a user-facing interface is uncertain, making it less suitable compared to Portkey or OpenRouter.

- **LiteLLM**: An open-source AI API proxy that allows users to connect their own API keys and use them through a unified API. It’s free, with no subscription fee, and users pay providers directly through their keys for token usage. However, it lacks a user-facing UI, making it more suitable for developers integrating into applications, not for direct user interaction like ChatBoxAI or OpenWebUI.

#### Analysis of Fit to User Requirements
- **Using Own API Keys**: Portkey and LiteLLM explicitly allow this, while OpenRouter does not, requiring users to use their API. Unify.ai’s BYOM feature is ambiguous but less user-focused.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing Based on Token Usage**: OpenRouter fits with its per-token pricing, but users don’t use their own keys. Portkey has a subscription model, which contradicts the user’s desire to avoid fees like $20/month. LiteLLM is free, aligning with no subscription, but lacks UI. No platform perfectly combines all requirements without trade-offs.
- **UI and Mistral Integration**: Both Portkey and OpenRouter have web-based UIs, potentially better than ChatBoxAI’s desktop client, and both support Mistral. User reviews suggest Portkey’s UI is user-friendly, while OpenRouter’s is simple. LiteLLM’s lack of UI makes it unsuitable for UI-focused needs.

#### Challenges and Trade-Offs
The primary challenge is the apparent lack of platforms that allow users to connect their own API keys, provide a unified user-facing interface, and charge based on token usage without a subscription fee. Most platforms either charge a subscription (like Portkey) or don’t allow personal API keys (like OpenRouter). This suggests a trade-off:
- Accept a subscription fee for platform features (Portkey) while using own keys.
- Use a pay-per-token model without own keys (OpenRouter), potentially losing cost control through personal keys.

#### Recommendation and Considerations
Given the user’s emphasis on using their own API keys and avoiding subscription fees, no perfect match was found. However, **Portkey** is recommended as the closest fit, allowing connection of personal API keys and offering a unified interface with a potentially better UI than ChatBoxAI. Despite the subscription fee (e.g., $49/month for Pro), it supports advanced features that may justify the cost for managing multiple AI models. Users should evaluate if the features outweigh the subscription cost, especially compared to paying providers directly through keys without a platform.

For those prioritizing pay-per-token without subscription and willing to forgo using personal keys, **OpenRouter** is an alternative, charging $0.0001 per token after 1000 free, with a simple web UI and Mistral support. However, this means relinquishing control over API keys, which may not align with the user’s ownership of multiple keys.

#### Conclusion
This analysis highlights the complexity of finding a platform that meets all user criteria. Portkey offers the best fit for using personal API keys with a unified interface, though at a subscription cost. OpenRouter provides a pay-per-token model without subscription but doesn’t support personal keys. Users may need to decide based on whether platform features or cost flexibility is more critical, potentially exploring open-source options like self-hosting OpenWebUI alternatives for free usage with personal keys.
