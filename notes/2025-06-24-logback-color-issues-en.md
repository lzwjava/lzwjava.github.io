You're asking a great question that gets into how terminals, logging libraries, and operating systems interact with colored output\!

The reason your Logback output might not be colorful in Gnome Terminal, even with `%highlight`, while Spring Boot's default is, comes down to a few factors:

1.  **ANSI Escape Codes:** Colored terminal output works by printing special character sequences called **ANSI escape codes**. These codes tell the terminal emulator (like Gnome Terminal) to change the foreground color, background color, reset colors, etc.
      * For example, `\u001B[31m` might set the text color to red, and `\u001B[0m` resets it.
2.  **Logback's `%highlight` Converter:** Logback's `%highlight` converter (and others like `%red`, `%green`, etc.) internally generates these ANSI escape codes. So, your `logback.xml` is indeed configured to produce colored output.
3.  **Terminal Emulators and ANSI Support:** Most modern Linux terminals, including Gnome Terminal, support ANSI escape codes by default. This isn't usually the problem on Linux.
4.  **Spring Boot's Default Configuration:** Spring Boot provides a very opinionated and often enhanced Logback configuration by default. This default configuration does several things:
      * It uses `PatternLayout` with `%highlight` and other color converters.
      * **Crucially, for Windows users, it often includes the `jansi` library.** Logback itself has a `withJansi` property you can set on a `ConsoleAppender`. On Windows, the command prompt (CMD.exe) doesn't natively interpret ANSI escape codes. The `jansi` library (Java ANSI Support) acts as an adapter, intercepting the ANSI codes and translating them into console-specific commands that Windows can understand. While Linux terminals typically don't *need* Jansi for basic ANSI support, sometimes its presence or absence can influence how Logback detects the "terminal capability" or how it flushes output, though this is less common on Linux.
      * Spring Boot's default setup might also include additional logic or properties that ensure colors are rendered consistently.

**Why your custom `logback.xml` might not show colors in Gnome Terminal:**

Since you're using `%highlight`, the ANSI codes *should* be there. If they're not appearing, consider these possibilities:

1.  **Is your `logback.xml` actually being picked up?**
      * Double-check its location: It should be in `src/main/resources/logback.xml` (or `logback-spring.xml` if you want Spring Boot to apply its defaults *and then* your customizations).
      * Look at your application's startup logs. Logback often prints messages indicating which configuration file it's loading. If you see messages about `BasicConfigurator` or a different file, your `logback.xml` isn't being used.
2.  **Redirecting Output:** Are you redirecting the output of your application?
      * If you pipe your application's output to a file (`java -jar your-app.jar > log.txt`) or another command, the terminal emulator won't interpret the ANSI codes, and you'll just see the raw escape sequences in the file.
      * Some tools or environments might strip ANSI codes, assuming the output isn't going to a "real" terminal.
3.  **Terminal Type Detection:** Logback's `ConsoleAppender` and its highlighting logic often try to detect if the output target is a "real" terminal (TTY). If it's not detected as a TTY (for example, if running in certain IDE consoles that don't fully emulate a TTY, or if output is piped), Logback might automatically suppress ANSI codes to avoid cluttering non-color-aware outputs.
      * Gnome Terminal is usually detected as a TTY, so this is less likely the primary issue, but it's worth noting.
4.  **`withJansi` for Cross-Platform Consistency (Less relevant for Linux, but good to know):** While Jansi is primarily for Windows, sometimes explicitly setting `<withJansi>true</withJansi>` within your `ConsoleAppender` in `logback.xml` can help ensure consistent behavior across platforms, even on Linux where it might not be strictly necessary. It often doesn't hurt.
5.  **Environment Variables:** Very rarely, certain environment variables (e.g., `TERM` or `CLICOLOR_FORCE`) can influence how terminals or applications handle color output. However, for a standard Gnome Terminal, this is unlikely to be the cause of *no* colors.

**To troubleshoot and ensure colors:**

1.  **Verify `logback.xml` is loaded:** Start your application and look for Logback's self-configuration messages. They'll tell you which configuration file is being used.
      * You can also add `debug="true"` to your `<configuration>` tag in `logback.xml` to get more verbose Logback internal status messages at startup:
        ```xml
        <configuration debug="true">
            </configuration>
        ```
2.  **Test a simple Java application with raw ANSI codes:**
    ```java
    public class AnsiTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("\u001B[31mThis text is red.\u001B[0m");
            System.out.println("\u001B[32mThis text is green.\u001B[0m");
            System.out.println("This text is default.");
        }
    }
    ```
    Compile and run this from your Gnome Terminal (`javac AnsiTest.java && java AnsiTest`). If this shows colors, then your terminal itself is capable, and the issue is likely with your Logback configuration or how it's being run. If this *doesn't* show colors, then there's something more fundamental with your Gnome Terminal setup (though highly unlikely).
3.  **Compare your `logback.xml` with Spring Boot's default:**
      * If you're using Spring Boot, you can often find its default `logback-spring.xml` (or similar) within the Spring Boot JARs or documentation. Comparing the `ConsoleAppender` sections might reveal subtle differences.
      * Spring Boot typically uses a pattern similar to:
        `%d{${LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN:-yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}} %highlight(${LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN:-%-5p}) ${PID:- } --- [%thread] %logger{40}.%M{1.}: %msg%n%throwable`
        Notice the use of system properties (`LOG_DATEFORMAT_PATTERN`, `LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN`, `PID`) which Spring Boot sets up for you.

By going through these steps, you should be able to pinpoint why your custom Logback configuration isn't producing colored output in your Gnome Terminal. The most common reason is that the `logback.xml` isn't being loaded or there's an issue with output redirection.
