Running a 64GB GGUF file on a local desktop with a 12GB NVIDIA GPU is challenging but potentially feasible with careful memory management, quantization, and layer offloading. However, there are no specific "executor batch" tools designed exclusively for precise GPU memory control in this context. Instead, you can leverage existing frameworks like `llama.cpp` or `Oobabooga's Text-Generation-WebUI` with quantization and offloading techniques to manage GPU memory. Below, I’ll outline the feasibility, challenges, and steps to attempt this.

### Feasibility and Challenges
1. **Memory Constraints**:
   - A 64GB GGUF file typically represents a large language model (e.g., a 70B parameter model at Q4_K_M quantization). Even with quantization, the model’s memory footprint during inference often exceeds the 12GB VRAM of your NVIDIA GPU.
   - To run such a model, you’ll need to offload most layers to system RAM and/or CPU, which significantly slows inference due to the lower bandwidth of RAM (60–120 GB/s) compared to GPU VRAM (hundreds of GB/s).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oobabooga/comments/1cnmtp7/gtx_4080_running_13b_gguf_am_i_doing_this_right/)
   - With 12GB VRAM, you can offload only a small number of layers (e.g., 5–10 layers for a 70B model), leaving the rest to system RAM. This requires substantial system RAM (ideally 64GB or more) to avoid swapping, which would make inference unbearably slow (minutes per token).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77077603/run-llama-2-70b-chat-model-on-single-gpu)

2. **Quantization**:
   - GGUF models support quantization levels like Q4_K_M, Q3_K_M, or even Q2_K to reduce memory usage. For a 70B model, Q4_K_M may require ~48–50GB total memory (VRAM + RAM), while Q2_K could drop to ~24–32GB but with significant quality loss.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77077603/run-llama-2-70b-chat-model-on-single-gpu)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oobabooga/comments/1cnmtp7/gtx_4080_running_13b_gguf_am_i_doing_this_right/)
   - Lower quantization (e.g., Q2_K) may allow more layers to fit in VRAM but degrades model performance, potentially making outputs less coherent.

3. **No Precise "Executor Batch" for GPU Memory**:
   - There’s no dedicated tool called "executor batch" for fine-grained GPU memory control in this context. However, `llama.cpp` and similar frameworks allow you to specify the number of layers offloaded to the GPU (`--n-gpu-layers`), effectively controlling VRAM usage.[](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-GGUF)
   - These tools don’t offer exact memory allocation (e.g., “use exactly 11.5GB VRAM”) but allow you to balance VRAM and RAM usage through layer offloading and quantization.

4. **Performance**:
   - With 12GB VRAM and heavy RAM offloading, expect slow inference speeds (e.g., 0.5–2 tokens/second for a 70B model).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1867ove/question_about_gguf_gpu_offload_and_performance/)
   - System RAM speed and CPU performance (e.g., single-thread performance, RAM bandwidth) become bottlenecks. Fast DDR4/DDR5 RAM (e.g., 3600 MHz) and a modern CPU help but won’t match GPU speeds.[](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/3847)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1867ove/question_about_gguf_gpu_offload_and_performance/)

5. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - You’ll need at least 64GB of system RAM to load the entire model (VRAM + RAM). With less RAM, the system may swap to disk, causing extreme slowdowns.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77077603/run-llama-2-70b-chat-model-on-single-gpu)
   - A modern CPU (e.g., Ryzen 7 or Intel i7) with high single-thread performance and multiple cores improves CPU-bound inference.

### Is It Possible?
Yes, it’s possible to run a 64GB GGUF model on a 12GB NVIDIA GPU, but with significant trade-offs:
- **Use high quantization** (e.g., Q2_K or Q3_K_M) to reduce the model’s memory footprint.
- **Offload most layers** to system RAM and CPU, using only a few layers on the GPU.
- **Accept slow inference speeds** (potentially 0.5–2 tokens/second).
- **Ensure sufficient system RAM** (64GB or more) to avoid swapping.

However, the experience may not be practical for interactive use due to slow response times. If speed is critical, consider a smaller model (e.g., 13B or 20B) or a GPU with more VRAM (e.g., RTX 3090 with 24GB).

### Steps to Attempt Running the 64GB GGUF File
Here’s how you can try running the model using `llama.cpp`, which supports GGUF and GPU offloading:

1. **Verify Hardware**:
   - Confirm your NVIDIA GPU has 12GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060 or 4080 mobile).
   - Ensure at least 64GB of system RAM. If you have less (e.g., 32GB), use aggressive quantization (Q2_K) and test for swapping.
   - Check CPU (e.g., 8+ cores, high clock speed) and RAM speed (e.g., DDR4 3600 MHz or DDR5).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (12.x) and cuDNN for GPU acceleration.
   - Clone and build `llama.cpp` with CUDA support:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
     cd llama.cpp
     make LLAMA_CUDA=1
     ```
   - Install Python bindings (`llama-cpp-python`) with CUDA:
     ```bash
     pip install llama-cpp-python --extra-index-url https://wheels.grok.ai
     ```

3. **Download the GGUF Model**:
   - Obtain the 64GB GGUF model (e.g., from Hugging Face, such as `TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GGUF`).
   - If possible, download a lower-quantized version (e.g., Q3_K_M or Q2_K) to reduce memory needs. For example:
     ```bash
     wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-70b-chat.Q3_K_M.gguf
     ```

4. **Configure Layer Offloading**:
   - Use `llama.cpp` to run the model, specifying GPU layers:
     ```bash
     ./llama-cli --model llama-2-70b-chat.Q3_K_M.gguf --n-gpu-layers 5 --threads 16 --ctx-size 2048
     ```
     - `--n-gpu-layers 5`: Offloads 5 layers to the GPU (adjust based on VRAM usage; start low to avoid OOM errors).
     - `--threads 16`: Uses 16 CPU threads (adjust to your CPU’s core count).
     - `--ctx-size 2048`: Sets context size (lower to save memory, e.g., 512 or 1024).
   - Monitor VRAM usage with `nvidia-smi`. If VRAM exceeds 12GB, reduce `--n-gpu-layers`.

5. **Optimize Quantization**:
   - If the model doesn’t fit or is too slow, try a lower quantization (e.g., Q2_K). Convert the model using `llama.cpp`’s quantization tools:
     ```bash
     ./quantize llama-2-70b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf llama-2-70b-chat.Q2_K.gguf q2_k
     ```
   - Note: Q2_K may degrade output quality significantly.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77077603/run-llama-2-70b-chat-model-on-single-gpu)

6. **Alternative Tools**:
   - Use `Oobabooga’s Text-Generation-WebUI` for a user-friendly interface:
     - Install: `git clone https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui`
     - Load the GGUF model with `llama.cpp` backend and configure GPU offloading in the UI.
     - Adjust parameters like `gpu_layers` in the settings to stay within 12GB VRAM.
   - Try `LM Studio` for simplified GGUF model management, though it’s less flexible for fine-tuning VRAM usage.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1867ove/question_about_gguf_gpu_offload_and_performance/)

7. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Run a simple prompt (e.g., “What is 1+1?”) and check token generation speed.
   - If inference is too slow (<0.5 tokens/second) or the system swaps, consider:
     - Reducing context size (`--ctx-size`).
     - Lowering quantization further.
     - Upgrading RAM or using a smaller model.

### Recommendations
- **Smaller Models**: A 13B or 20B GGUF model (e.g., `Llama-2-13B-chat.Q4_K_M`, ~8–12GB) can fully fit in 12GB VRAM, offering faster inference (10–25 tokens/second) and better quality than a heavily quantized 70B model.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1765g70/from_no_gpu_to_a_3060_12gb_what_can_i_run/)
- **More VRAM**: If possible, upgrade to a GPU with 16GB (RTX 4080) or 24GB (RTX 3090) VRAM to offload more layers and improve speed.
- **System RAM**: Ensure 64GB+ RAM to handle offloaded layers without swapping. If you have 32GB, stick to Q2_K quantization.
- **Avoid Q2_K for Critical Use**: Q2_K quantization may render the model unusable for complex tasks due to quality loss.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1765g70/from_no_gpu_to_a_3060_12gb_what_can_i_run/)

### Why No “Executor Batch”?
The term “executor batch” likely refers to batch processing or memory management tools, but no such tool exists specifically for GPU memory control in LLMs. Frameworks like `llama.cpp` provide the closest functionality by allowing layer offloading and quantization. For precise memory control, you’d need to manually tune parameters (`--n-gpu-layers`, quantization level) and monitor with `nvidia-smi`. Advanced users could explore custom memory management in PyTorch or CUDA, but this is complex and not well-supported for GGUF models.

### Conclusion
Running a 64GB GGUF file on a 12GB NVIDIA GPU is possible with `llama.cpp`, high quantization (Q3_K_M or Q2_K), and sufficient system RAM (64GB+), but it will be slow (0.5–2 tokens/second) and may compromise quality.
