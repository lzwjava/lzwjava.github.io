GitHub Copilot Chat is an AI-powered assistant integrated into both JetBrains IDEA and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to help developers with coding tasks through natural language interactions, code suggestions, and context-aware assistance. While the core functionality of Copilot Chat is similar across both IDEs, there are differences in implementation, context handling, and feature availability due to the distinct architectures and ecosystems of JetBrains IDEA and VS Code. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the differences, with a focus on how recent files are handled as context and other key distinctions.

---

### **1. Context Awareness and Handling of Recent Files**
One of the primary differences between Copilot Chat in JetBrains IDEA and VS Code lies in how they handle context, particularly the inclusion of recent files.

#### **JetBrains IDEA: Context with Recent Files**
- **Behavior**: In JetBrains IDEA, Copilot Chat tends to leverage the IDE’s robust project indexing and context-awareness capabilities. JetBrains IDEs are known for their deep understanding of project structure, including file relationships, dependencies, and recently opened files. Copilot Chat in IDEA uses this to include recent files as part of the context for generating responses, even if they are not explicitly referenced by the user.
- **Mechanism**: When you interact with Copilot Chat in JetBrains IDEA, it draws context from:
  - The currently open file in the editor.
  - Recently opened or active files in the project, which are part of the IDE’s internal index.
  - The project’s codebase structure, especially when using features like the `@project` context (introduced in early 2025), which allows Copilot to analyze the entire codebase for relevant files and symbols.[](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-19-boost-your-productivity-with-github-copilot-in-jetbrains-ides-introducing-project-context-ai-generated-commit-messages-and-other-updates/)
- **Advantages**:
  - **Seamless Integration with Project Context**: JetBrains’ indexing makes it easier for Copilot to provide suggestions that align with the project’s structure, such as referencing classes, methods, or dependencies in recently edited files.
  - **Recent Files as Implicit Context**: If you’ve recently worked on a file, Copilot may include it in its context without requiring manual specification, which is useful for maintaining continuity in a coding session.
- **Limitations**:
  - The reliance on recent files can sometimes lead to less precise context if the IDE includes irrelevant files. For example, if you’ve opened many files recently, Copilot might pull in outdated or unrelated context.
  - Until recently (e.g., the `@project` feature in February 2025), JetBrains lacked an explicit way to include the entire codebase as context, unlike VS Code.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1fyf6oj/github_copilot_on_jetbrains_dont_have_option_to/)

#### **VS Code: Context with Explicit and Flexible Options**
- **Behavior**: In VS Code, Copilot Chat has more explicit and customizable context management, with features like `#codebase`, `#file`, and other chat variables that allow users to define the scope of context. While it can use recently opened files, it does not automatically prioritize them as heavily as JetBrains IDEA unless explicitly instructed.
- **Mechanism**: VS Code’s Copilot Chat gathers context from:
  - The active file in the editor.
  - Files explicitly referenced using `#file` or `#codebase` in the chat prompt. For example, `#codebase` searches the entire workspace, while `#file:<filename>` targets a specific file.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context)
  - Workspace indexing, which can include a local or remote (GitHub-hosted) index of the codebase, especially when the `github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled` setting is enabled.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context)
  - Additional context sources like terminal output, test results, or web content via `#fetch` or `#githubRepo`.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context)
- **Advantages**:
  - **Granular Control**: Users can precisely specify which files or parts of the codebase to include, reducing noise from irrelevant files.
  - **Whole-Codebase Search**: The `@workspace` and `#codebase` features allow Copilot to search across all indexable files in the workspace, which is particularly powerful for large projects.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context)
  - **Dynamic Context Addition**: Features like drag-and-drop images, terminal output, or web references provide flexibility for adding diverse context types.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)
- **Limitations**:
  - VS Code does not automatically prioritize recently opened files as heavily as JetBrains IDEA, which may require users to manually specify context more often.
  - For very large codebases, the context might be limited to the most relevant files due to indexing constraints (e.g., local indexes are capped at 2500 files).[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context)

#### **Key Difference in Recent Files Context**
- **JetBrains IDEA**: Automatically includes recently opened files as part of its context due to the IDE’s project indexing, making it feel more “implicit” and seamless for users working within a single project. However, this can sometimes include irrelevant files if the user has opened many files recently.
- **VS Code**: Requires more explicit context specification (e.g., `#file` or `#codebase`) but offers greater control and flexibility. Recent files are not automatically prioritized unless they are open in the editor or explicitly referenced.

### **2. Feature Availability and Integration**
Both IDEs support Copilot Chat, but the depth of integration and feature rollout differ due to the development priorities of GitHub (owned by Microsoft, which also maintains VS Code) and the distinct ecosystems of JetBrains and VS Code.

#### **JetBrains IDEA: Tighter IDE Integration but Slower Feature Rollout**
- **Integration**: Copilot Chat is deeply integrated into JetBrains IDEA through the GitHub Copilot plugin, leveraging the IDE’s robust features like IntelliSense, project indexing, and refactoring tools. Inline Chat, introduced in September 2024, allows users to interact with Copilot directly in the code editor (Shift+Ctrl+I on Mac, Shift+Ctrl+G on Windows).[](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-09-11-inline-chat-is-now-available-in-github-copilot-in-jetbrains/)
- **Features**:
  - **Inline Chat**: Supports focused interactions for refactoring, testing, and code improvement within the active file.[](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-09-11-inline-chat-is-now-available-in-github-copilot-in-jetbrains/)
  - **@project Context**: As of February 2025, Copilot in JetBrains supports querying the entire codebase with `@project`, providing detailed answers with references to relevant files and symbols.[](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-19-boost-your-productivity-with-github-copilot-in-jetbrains-ides-introducing-project-context-ai-generated-commit-messages-and-other-updates/)

- **Limitations**:
  - Features often lag behind VS Code. For example, multi-model support (e.g., Claude, Gemini) and multi-file editing in agent mode were introduced in VS Code before JetBrains.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gfjbta/is_jetbrains_bringing_the_new_copilotvs_code/)
  - Some advanced features, like attaching images to prompts or agent mode for autonomous multi-file edits, are not yet fully supported in JetBrains as of the latest updates.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat)[](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)
- **Performance**: JetBrains’ heavier IDE environment may result in slightly slower Copilot responses compared to VS Code, especially in large projects, due to the overhead of its indexing and analysis engine.

#### **VS Code: Faster Feature Rollout and Broader Functionality**
- **Integration**: As a Microsoft product, VS Code benefits from tighter integration with GitHub Copilot and faster feature rollouts. Copilot Chat is seamlessly embedded in the editor, with access through the Chat view, inline chat (⌘I on Mac, Ctrl+I on Windows), or smart actions via the context menu.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat)
- **Features**:
  - **Multiple Chat Modes**: Supports ask mode (general questions), edit mode (multi-file edits with user control), and agent mode (autonomous multi-file edits with terminal commands).[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)[](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)
  - **Custom Instructions and Prompt Files**: Users can define coding practices in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `.prompt.md` files to customize responses across both VS Code and Visual Studio.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
  - **Image Attachments**: Since Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 1, users can attach images to prompts for additional context, a feature not yet available in JetBrains.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat?view=vs-2022)
  - **Multi-Model Support**: VS Code supports multiple language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini), allowing users to switch models for different tasks.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gfjbta/is_jetbrains_bringing_the_new_copilotvs_code/)
  - **Workspace Indexing**: The `@workspace` feature and `#codebase` searches provide comprehensive codebase context, enhanced by remote indexing for GitHub-hosted repositories.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context)
- **Advantages**:
  - **Rapid Feature Updates**: VS Code often receives Copilot features first, such as agent mode and multi-model support.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gfjbta/is_jetbrains_bringing_the_new_copilotvs_code/)
  - **Lightweight and Flexible**: VS Code’s lightweight nature makes Copilot responses faster in most cases, and its extension ecosystem allows for additional AI tools or customizations.
- **Limitations**:
  - Less robust project indexing compared to JetBrains, which may require more manual context specification.
  - The extension-based architecture can feel less cohesive than JetBrains’ all-in-one IDE experience for some users.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1fyf6oj/github_copilot_on_jetbrains_dont_have_option_to/)

### **4. Specific Differences in Context of Latest Files**
- **JetBrains IDEA**:
  - Automatically includes recently opened files in the context, leveraging the IDE’s project indexing. This is particularly useful for developers who frequently switch between related files in a project.
  - The `@project` feature (introduced February 2025) allows querying the entire codebase, but recent files are still prioritized implicitly due to JetBrains’ indexing.[](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-19-boost-your-productivity-with-github-copilot-in-jetbrains-ides-introducing-project-context-ai-generated-commit-messages-and-other-updates/)
  - Example: If you’ve recently edited a `utils.py` file and ask Copilot to generate a function, it may automatically consider code from `utils.py` without needing to specify it.
- **VS Code**:
  - Relies on explicit context specification (e.g., `#file:utils.py` or `#codebase`) rather than automatically prioritizing recent files. However, open files in the editor are included in the context by default.[](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/51323)
  - Example: To include `utils.py` in the context, you must explicitly reference it or have it open in the editor, or use `#codebase` to search the entire workspace.
- **Practical Impact**:
  - **JetBrains**: Better for workflows where recent files are likely relevant, reducing the need for manual context specification.
  - **VS Code**: Better for workflows where precise control over context is preferred, especially in large projects where recent files might not always be relevant.

### **5. Other Notable Differences**
- **Multi-Model Support**:
  - **VS Code**: Supports multiple language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini), allowing users to switch based on task requirements.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gfjbta/is_jetbrains_bringing_the_new_copilotvs_code/)
  - **JetBrains IDEA**: Lags in multi-model support, with Copilot primarily using GitHub’s default models. JetBrains’ own AI Assistant may offer alternative models, but integration with Copilot is limited.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1gfjbta/is_jetbrains_bringing_the_new_copilotvs_code/)
- **Agent Mode**:
  - **VS Code**: Supports agent mode, which autonomously edits multiple files and runs terminal commands to complete tasks.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)
  - **JetBrains IDEA**: Agent mode is not yet available, limiting Copilot to user-controlled edits or single-file interactions.[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/github-copilot-features)
- **Custom Instructions**:
  - **VS Code**: Supports custom instructions via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and prompt files, allowing users to define coding practices and project requirements.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
  - **JetBrains IDEA**: Supports similar custom instructions but is less flexible, as the focus is on leveraging JetBrains’ built-in indexing rather than external configuration files.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
- **Performance**:
  - **VS Code**: Generally faster due to its lightweight architecture, especially for smaller projects.
  - **JetBrains IDEA**: May experience slight delays in large projects due to the IDE’s resource-intensive indexing, but this enables richer context awareness.
