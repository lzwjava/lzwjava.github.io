It looks like your question is about smart home setups, specifically wanting something stable that could integrate with a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) for control, whether Huawei uses a specific protocol for this, and if Huawei's smart home ecosystem is more stable than Xiaomi's. I'll break it down step by step based on available info.

### Does Huawei Use a PLC-Related Protocol for Smart Homes?
Yes, Huawei incorporates PLC (Power Line Communication) technology extensively in its smart home solutions, particularly through its proprietary **PLC-IoT protocol**. This is a narrowband IoT standard that transmits data over existing electrical wiring, making it highly reliable for whole-home connectivity without needing extra cables or Wi-Fi hotspots everywhere. It's designed for stability in scenarios like controlling lights, appliances, security systems, and HVAC—perfect if you're integrating a PLC for industrial or automated home control.

- Huawei's "All-in-One Smart Home" solution uses PLC-IoT as a core "home bus" for low-bandwidth, always-on connections (up to 2 Mbit/s over kilometers via multi-hop networking). It integrates with HarmonyOS for seamless device linking and supports IPv6 for broad IoT compatibility.
- This outperforms common alternatives like Zigbee in wall penetration, interference resistance, and reliability (e.g., Huawei's tests show it handles power noise and attenuation better for home use).
- For direct PLC integration (like a controller), Huawei's HiLink/HarmonyOS Connect protocol allows open access for third-party devices, so you could connect a standard PLC via their SDK or cloud APIs. Their WiFi Q2 series even hybrids PLC with mesh Wi-Fi for up to 1.8 Gbps stable speeds.

Xiaomi, by contrast, relies more on Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth via its Mi Home app—great for affordability but less focused on wired PLC-like stability.

### Is Huawei's Smart Home More Stable Than Xiaomi's?
Overall, **yes, Huawei edges out Xiaomi in long-term stability and reliability**, especially for whole-home setups. Huawei's ecosystem (built on HarmonyOS and PLC-IoT) emphasizes robust, interference-proof networking and open interoperability, while Xiaomi's (on Mi Home/HyperOS) shines in short-term affordability but can suffer from ecosystem fragmentation.

- **Stability Pros for Huawei**:
  - PLC-IoT ensures "always-on" reliability—even during Wi-Fi outages or power fluctuations—reducing latency to under 100ms for controls.
  - Open protocol supports 200M+ device connections across brands, with better supply chain consistency (fewer "de-Xiaomi" issues from partners).
  - User reports and tests highlight superior hardware durability (e.g., Huawei wearables last 2+ years vs. Xiaomi's occasional screen failures).

- **Xiaomi's Strengths (But Trade-offs)**:
  - Faster short-term growth with 200M+ connected devices, but more closed ecosystem means potential glitches in multi-brand setups.
  - Relies on stacking single products (e.g., Zigbee hubs), which can lead to instability in large homes due to signal drops.

| Aspect | Huawei (HarmonyOS + PLC-IoT) | Xiaomi (Mi Home + Zigbee/Wi-Fi) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Core Protocol** | PLC-IoT (wired power line, high reliability) | Zigbee/Wi-Fi (wireless, cost-effective but prone to interference) |
| **Stability/Reliability** | Excellent (low latency, wall-proof, always-on) | Good short-term, but ecosystem fragmentation risks |
| **PLC Integration** | Native support via home bus | Possible via adapters, but not core |
| **Ecosystem Openness** | Highly open (multi-brand) | More closed (own brands dominant) |
| **Best For** | Whole-home automation with PLC | Budget multi-device stacking |

If stability with PLC is your priority, go Huawei—it's more future-proof for integrated control. For a cheaper entry, Xiaomi works fine but might need tweaks for reliability. Let me know if you need setup tips!
