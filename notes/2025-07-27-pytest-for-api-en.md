### Recommended Python Test Frameworks for API Endpoint Testing

For testing server endpoints written in Java (e.g., Spring Boot), you can use Python frameworks to perform integration or endpoint tests by sending HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and verifying response codes, headers, and body content. Since the server is in Java, treat it as a black-box API and use Python's HTTP client libraries (like `requests` or `httpx`) to interact with it. The most common setup involves a test runner framework combined with an HTTP library.

Here are some strong choices, prioritized by popularity and suitability for your use case (based on recent recommendations as of 2025). I'll focus on those that support easy HTTP interactions and response validation:

#### 1. **pytest (with requests or httpx library)**
   - **Why it's good**: pytest is the most popular Python testing framework for unit, integration, and API tests. It's flexible, has a simple syntax, and supports fixtures for setup/teardown (e.g., starting a test server or mocking). You can write tests to send GET/POST requests and assert on status codes (e.g., 200 OK) and JSON responses. It's extensible with plugins like `pytest-httpx` for async testing.
   - **How to use for your scenario**:
     - Install: `pip install pytest requests` (or `pip install pytest httpx` for async).
     - Example test:
       ```python
       import requests
       import pytest

       @pytest.fixture
       def base_url():
           return "http://your-java-server:8080"

       def test_get_endpoint(base_url):
           response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/api/resource")
           assert response.status_code == 200
           assert "expected_key" in response.json()

       def test_post_endpoint(base_url):
           data = {"key": "value"}
           response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/api/resource", json=data)
           assert response.status_code == 201
           assert response.json()["status"] == "created"
       ```
     - Pros: Readable, community plugins, parallel execution, great for CI/CD.
     - Cons: Requires some coding; not purely declarative.
   - Best for: Integration tests where you need custom logic.

#### 2. **Tavern**
   - **Why it's good**: Tavern is a pytest plugin specifically for RESTful API testing. It uses YAML files to define tests declaratively, making it easy to specify HTTP methods, payloads, and expected responses without much Python code. Ideal for endpoint validation, including status codes and JSON schema checks.
   - **How to use for your scenario**:
     - Install: `pip install tavern`.
     - Example YAML test file:
       ```yaml
       test_name: Test GET endpoint
       stages:
         - name: Get resource
           request:
             url: http://your-java-server:8080/api/resource
             method: GET
           response:
             status_code: 200
             json:
               expected_key: expected_value

       test_name: Test POST endpoint
       stages:
         - name: Post resource
           request:
             url: http://your-java-server:8080/api/resource
             method: POST
             json: { "key": "value" }
           response:
             status_code: 201
             json:
               status: created
       ```
     - Run with `pytest your_test.yaml`.
   - Pros: Human-readable YAML, integrates with pytest, automatic retries and validation.
   - Cons: Less flexible for complex logic compared to pure Python.
   - Best for: Quick, declarative API tests focused on endpoints.

#### 3. **PyRestTest**
   - **Why it's good**: A lightweight Python tool for REST API testing using YAML or JSON configs. It's code-free for basic tests, supports benchmarking, and is great for validating HTTP responses from external servers like your Java endpoints.
   - **How to use for your scenario**:
     - Install: `pip install pyresttest`.
     - Example YAML:
       ```yaml
       - config:
           url: http://your-java-server:8080
       - test:
           name: GET test
           url: /api/resource
           method: GET
           expected_status: [200]
           validators:
             - {jsonpath_mini: 'expected_key', expected: 'expected_value'}
       - test:
           name: POST test
           url: /api/resource
           method: POST
           body: '{"key": "value"}'
           expected_status: [201]
           validators:
             - {jsonpath_mini: 'status', expected: 'created'}
       ```
     - Run with `pyresttest http://base-url test.yaml`.
   - Pros: Simple setup, no boilerplate code, portable.
   - Cons: Limited community compared to pytest; older tool but still maintained.
   - Best for: Micro-benchmarking and simple integration tests.

#### 4. **Robot Framework (with RequestsLibrary)**
   - **Why it's good**: A keyword-driven framework for acceptance and API testing. With the `RequestsLibrary`, it handles HTTP requests natively and is extensible for integration tests. Good for teams preferring readable, non-code tests.
   - **How to use for your scenario**:
     - Install: `pip install robotframework robotframework-requests`.
     - Example test file:
       ```
       *** Settings ***
       Library    RequestsLibrary

       *** Test Cases ***
       Test GET Endpoint
           Create Session    mysession    http://your-java-server:8080
           ${response}=    GET On Session    mysession    /api/resource
           Status Should Be    200    ${response}
           ${json}=    To Json    ${response.content}
           Should Be Equal    ${json['expected_key']}    expected_value

       Test POST Endpoint
           Create Session    mysession    http://your-java-server:8080
           ${data}=    Create Dictionary    key=value
           ${response}=    POST On Session    mysession    /api/resource    json=${data}
           Status Should Be    201    ${response}
           ${json}=    To Json    ${response.content}
           Should Be Equal    ${json['status']}    created
       ```
     - Run with `robot your_test.robot`.
   - Pros: Keyword-based (easy for non-devs), reporting built-in.
   - Cons: Verbose syntax; steeper learning for Python purists.
   - Best for: BDD-style integration tests.

#### Additional Tips
- **Common Library: requests**: Almost all frameworks pair well with this for HTTP calls. It's simple (`response = requests.get(url)`), handles JSON automatically, and is battle-tested.
- **Alternative to requests: httpx**: Use if you need async support (e.g., for high-throughput tests). Install via `pip install httpx`.
- **Setup for Java Server**: Ensure your Java server is running locally or remotely. For integration tests, consider Docker to spin up the Spring Boot app in CI/CD.
- **Best Overall Pick**: Start with pytest + requests for flexibility. If you prefer declarative tests, go with Tavern or PyRestTest.
- **Considerations**: These work cross-language since they use standard HTTP. For schema validation, add libraries like `jsonschema`. Run in CI/CD with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
