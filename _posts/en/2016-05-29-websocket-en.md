Hello, I’m Li Zhiwei. As the founder and CTO of CodeReview platform and a former engineer at LeanCloud, I have extensive experience with WebSocket, especially through the development of the IM SDK. 

### The Relevance of WebSocket
WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It's widely used in modern applications requiring real-time interaction such as instant messaging, real-time comments, multiplayer games, collaborative editing, and live stock prices.

### Modern Applications of WebSocket
WebSocket is extensively applied in:
- **Instant Messaging (IM)**
- **Real-time Comments**
- **Multiplayer Games**
- **Collaborative Editing**
- **Real-time Stock Prices**

### Evolution of WebSocket
**Polling:** The client frequently requests updates from the server.
**Long Polling:** The server holds the request open until new information is available.
**HTTP Bi-directional Connections:** Requires multiple connections for sending and receiving, and HTTP headers with each request.
**Single TCP Connection (WebSocket):** Overcomes limitations of HTTP bi-directional connections, offering higher real-time capabilities and lower latency.

### Implementing WebSocket on iOS

**Popular iOS WebSocket Libraries:**
- **SocketRocket (Objective-C, 4910 Stars)**
- **Starscream (Swift, 1714 Stars)**
- **SwiftWebSocket (Swift, 435 Stars)**

### Using SRWebSocket

1. **Initialization and Connection:**
   ```objective-c
   SRWebSocket *webSocket = [[SRWebSocket alloc] initWithURLRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"ws://echo.websocket.org"]]];
   webSocket.delegate = self;
   [webSocket open];
   ```

2. **Sending Messages:**
   ```objective-c
   [webSocket send:@"Hello, World!"];
   ```

3. **Receiving Messages:**
   Implement the `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods to handle incoming messages and events.

4. **Error Handling and Event Notifications:**
   Properly handle errors and notify users of connection issues.

### Detailed WebSocket Protocol Explanation

WebSocket operates on top of TCP and introduces several enhancements:
- **Security Model:** Adds a browser-based origin security model.
- **Address and Protocol Naming:** Supports multiple services on a single port and multiple domains on a single IP address.
- **Frame Mechanism:** Enhances TCP with an IP packet-like frame mechanism without length limitations.
- **Closing Handshake:** Ensures a clean closure of connections.

### WebSocket Protocol Core

**1. Handshake:**
   The WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade mechanism:
   - **Client Request:**
     ```http
     GET /chat HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
     Origin: http://example.com
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
     Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
     ```

   - **Server Response:**
     ```http
     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
     ```

**2. Data Transmission:**
   WebSocket frames can contain UTF-8 text, binary data, and control frames like close, ping, and pong.

**3. Security:**
   Browsers automatically add the Origin header, which cannot be forged by other clients.

### WebSocket URIs

- **ws-URI:** `ws://host:port/path?query`
- **wss-URI:** `wss://host:port/path?query`

### WebSocket Frame Protocol

**Frame Structure:**
- **FIN (1 bit):** Indicates if this is the final fragment in a message.
- **RSV1, RSV2, RSV3 (1 bit each):** Reserved for future use.
- **Opcode (4 bits):** Defines the interpretation of the payload data.
  - `0x0`: Continuation frame
  - `0x1`: Text frame
  - `0x2`: Binary frame
  - `0x8`: Connection close
  - `0x9`: Ping
  - `0xA`: Pong
- **Mask (1 bit):** Indicates if the payload data is masked.
- **Payload Length (7 bits):** Length of the payload data.

**Masking Key:** Used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by masking frames from the client.

### Closing Handshake

**Close Frame:**
- Can include a body indicating the reason for closure.
- Both sides must send and respond to close frames.

### Examples

**Example 1: Single-frame Unmasked Text Message**
```hex
0x81 0x05 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f
```
Contains "Hello"

**Example 2: Single-frame Masked Text Message**
```hex
0x81 0x85 0x37 0xfa 0x21 0x3d 0x7f 0x9f 0x4d 0x51 0x58
```
Contains "Hello" with a masking key

**Example 3: Fragmented Unmasked Text Message**
```hex
0x01 0x03 0x48 0x65 0x6c
0x80 0x02 0x6c 0x6f
```
Contains "Hel" and "lo" in two frames

### Advanced Topics

**Masking and Unmasking:**
- Masking is used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Each frame from the client must be masked.
- The masking key is chosen randomly for each frame.

**Fragmentation:**
- Used to send messages of unknown length.
- A fragmented message starts with a frame where FIN is 0 and ends with a frame where FIN is 1.

**Control Frames:**
- Control frames (like close, ping, and pong) have specific opcodes.
- These frames help manage the state of the WebSocket connection.

### Augmented Backus-Naur Form

- WebSocket uses ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) for defining message frames and data structures.

### Implementing WebSocket in Different Scenarios

**1. Real-time Chat Applications:**
- WebSocket can maintain an open connection to deliver messages instantly.

**2. Live Updates:**
- Stock prices, sports scores, and other real-time data can be pushed to clients as soon as they change.

**3. Multiplayer Games:**
- Synchronizes game state across multiple players with minimal latency.

### Conclusion

WebSocket significantly enhances real-time communication capabilities for web and mobile applications by providing a robust and efficient protocol built on top of TCP. By understanding and implementing WebSocket, developers can create more responsive and interactive applications. Whether you are developing for IM, real-time commenting, or multiplayer gaming, WebSocket is a powerful tool in your development arsenal.
