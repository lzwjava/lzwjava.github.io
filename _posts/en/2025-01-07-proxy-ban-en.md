## Can APIs in Proxy Servers Avoid GFW Bans?

I run a simple server on my Shadowsocks instance with the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)  # Enable CORS for all routes

@app.route('/bandwidth', methods=['GET'])
def get_bandwidth():
    # Run the vnstat command to get the 5-minute interval traffic statistics for eth0
    result = subprocess.run(['vnstat', '-i', 'eth0', '-5', '--json'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    data = result.stdout

    # Return the captured data as a JSON response
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

And I use nginx to serve port 443 as shown below:

```bash
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name www.some-domain.xyz;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.some-domain.xyz/fullchain.pem; # managed by 
    # ...
    location / {

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
        # ...
    }
}
```

This server program provides network data, and I use the server as my proxy server, allowing me to display my online status on my blog using the network data.

What's interesting is that the server hasn't been banned by the Great Firewall (GFW) or any other network control systems for several days now. Normally, the proxy server I set up would be banned within one or two days. The server runs a Shadowsocks program on a port like 51939, so it operates with Shadowsocks traffic mixed with regular API traffic. This mix seems to lead the GFW to believe the server is not a dedicated proxy, but rather a normal server, preventing it from banning the IP.

This observation is intriguing. It seems that the GFW uses specific logic to differentiate proxy traffic from regular traffic. While many websites like Twitter and YouTube are blocked in China, numerous foreign websites—such as those of international universities and companies—remain accessible.

This suggests that the GFW likely operates based on rules that distinguish between normal HTTP/HTTPS traffic and proxy-related traffic. Servers that handle both types of traffic seem to avoid bans, whereas servers handling only proxy traffic are more likely to be blocked.

One question is what time range the GFW uses to accumulate data for banning—whether it’s one day or one hour. During this time range, it detects whether the traffic is exclusively from a proxy. If it is, the server’s IP gets banned.

I often visit my blog to review what I’ve written, but in the coming weeks, my focus will shift to other tasks instead of writing blog posts. This will reduce my access to the `bandwidth` API through port 443. If I find that I get banned again, I should write a program to regularly access this API to trick the GFW.

Here’s the refined version of your text with improved structure and clarity:

## How the Great Firewall (GFW) works.

### Step 1: Logging Requests

```python
import time

# Database to store request data
request_log = []

# Function to log requests
def log_request(source_ip, target_ip, target_port, body):
    request_log.append({
        'source_ip': source_ip,
        'target_ip': target_ip,
        'target_port': target_port,
        'body': body,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    })
```

The `log_request` function records incoming requests with essential information like the source IP, target IP, target port, request body, and timestamp.

### Step 2: Checking and Banning IPs

```python
# Function to check requests and ban IPs
def check_and_ban_ips():
    banned_ips = set()

    # Iterate over all logged requests
    for request in request_log:
        if is_illegal(request):
            banned_ips.add(request['target_ip'])
        else:
            banned_ips.discard(request['target_ip'])

    # Apply bans to all identified IPs
    ban_ips(banned_ips)
```

The `check_and_ban_ips` function iterates through all logged requests, identifying and banning IPs that are associated with illegal activity.

### Step 3: Defining What Makes a Request Illegal

```python
# Function to simulate checking if a request is illegal
def is_illegal(request):
    # Placeholder for actual illegal request check logic
    # For example, checking request body or target
    return "illegal" in request['body']
```

Here, `is_illegal` checks whether the request body contains the word "illegal." This can be expanded to more sophisticated logic depending on what constitutes illegal activity.

### Step 4: Banning Identified IPs

```python
# Function to ban a list of IPs
def ban_ips(ip_set):
    for ip in ip_set:
        print(f"Banning IP: {ip}")
```

Once illegal IPs are identified, the `ban_ips` function bans them by printing their IP addresses (or, in a real system, it could block them).

### Step 5: Alternative Method for Checking and Banning IPs Based on 80% Illegal Requests

```python
# Function to check requests and ban IPs based on 80% illegal requests
def check_and_ban_ips():
    banned_ips = set()
    illegal_count = 0
    total_requests = 0

    # Iterate over all logged requests
    for request in request_log:
        total_requests += 1
        if is_illegal(request):
            illegal_count += 1

    # If 80% or more of the requests are illegal, ban those IPs
    if total_requests > 0 and (illegal_count / total_requests) >= 0.8:
        for request in request_log:
            if is_illegal(request):
                banned_ips.add(request['target_ip'])

    # Apply bans to all identified IPs
    ban_ips(banned_ips)
```

This alternative method evaluates whether an IP should be banned based on the percentage of illegal requests. If 80% or more of the requests from an IP are illegal, it is banned.

### Step 6: Enhanced Illegal Request Check (e.g., Shadowsocks and Trojan Protocol Detection)

```python
def is_illegal(request):
    # Check if the request uses the Shadowsocks protocol (body contains binary-like data)
    if request['target_port'] == 443:
        if is_trojan(request):
            return True
    elif is_shadowsocks(request):
        return True
    return False
```

The `is_illegal` function now also checks for specific protocols like Shadowsocks and Trojan:
- **Shadowsocks**: We might check for encrypted or binary-like data in the request body.
- **Trojan**: If the request comes over port 443 (HTTPS) and matches specific patterns (e.g., Trojan traffic characteristics), it is flagged as illegal.

### Step 7: Legal Requests Example

For instance, requests like `GET https://some-domain.xyz/bandwidth` are surely legal and won’t trigger the banning mechanism.

### Step 8: Proxy Server Traffic Characteristics

Proxy servers have very different traffic characteristics compared to regular web or API servers. The GFW needs to distinguish between normal web server traffic and proxy server traffic, which can look completely different.

### Step 9: Machine Learning and AI Models for Smart Detection

Given the wide range of requests and responses that pass through the internet, the GFW could employ AI and machine learning models to analyze traffic patterns and intelligently detect illegal behavior. By training the system on a variety of traffic types and using advanced techniques, it could more effectively ban or filter traffic based on observed patterns.

## Update

Despite my efforts, my proxy server continues to be banned. To mitigate this, I've implemented a workaround using Digital Ocean's reversed IP feature, which allows me to quickly assign a new IP address whenever a ban occurs.
