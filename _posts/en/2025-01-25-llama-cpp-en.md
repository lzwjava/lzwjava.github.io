## llama.cpp

When attempting to run `llama.cpp` with a model, you might encounter an error like this:

```bash
% ./main -m models/7B/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf
main: build = 964 (f3c3b4b)
main: seed  = 1737736417
llama.cpp: loading model from models/7B/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf
error loading model: unknown (magic, version) combination: 46554747, 00000003; is this really a GGML file?
llama_load_model_from_file: failed to load model
llama_init_from_gpt_params: error: failed to load model 'models/7B/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf'
main: error: unable to load model
```

This error occurs because you are running the `main` program. Running the `llama-cli` or `llama-server` programs located under `build/bin` should resolve the issue.

The `main` program was created on Aug 8 2023, which means it is not the current build.

Another solution is to install `llama.cpp` using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
```

This ensures that you have a compatible version of the library.

## Serving the Model

```bash
/home/lzw/Projects/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server -m /home/lzw/Projects/llama.cpp/models/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B-Q5_K_M.gguf --port 8000  --ctx-size 2048 --batch-size 512 --n-gpu-layers 49 --threads 8 --parallel 1
```

The parameters `--ctx-size 2048 --batch-size 512 --n-gpu-layers 49 --threads 8 --parallel 1` are important. They will boost the speed.


## LLM Farm

It's a great iOS app. In the settings, there are around 20 models. When importing a GGUF model by ourselves, which are downloaded from Hugging Face, it may lead to a crash.

## Benefits

Self-hosting these LLM models allows you to run them locally without needing network access. For example, when downloading large files that congest the network, running a local model can be beneficial.
