title: 'Open Source Tool: Auto SS Config'
translated: false
---

I'm excited to announce that I've open-sourced a tool called **Auto SS Config**. This tool automatically generates and uploads Shadowsocks or Clash subscription URLs from Shadowsocks URLs, making it easier to manage and update your proxy server configurations.

This tool has been a game-changer for me, especially when my Shadowsocks server gets blocked. I use Outline Manager to create a new server, obtain a fresh address, and import this URL directly using the Mac app to bypass GFW restrictions. Running `python upload_configs.py` from this project updates my subscription URLs, ensuring all my digital devices maintain functional network connections.

## Features

- **Converts Shadowsocks URLs to Clash configuration**: Easily switch between different proxy configurations.
- **Supports multiple Shadowsocks servers**: Manage multiple servers with ease.
- **Automatically uploads configurations to Google Cloud Storage**: Keep your configurations secure and accessible.
- **Makes configurations publicly accessible**: Share your configurations with others.
- **Uses cache control for immediate updates**: Ensure your configurations are always up-to-date.

## Files

- `app_config_tmp.yaml`: Application configuration (bucket name, SS URLs).
- `clash_config_tmp.yaml`: Temporary Clash configuration file.
- `upload_configs.py`: Script to generate Clash config and upload configs to Google Cloud Storage.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Set up Google Cloud credentials**:
    - Install Google Cloud SDK.
    - Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
    - Or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

3. **Copy `app_config_tmp.yaml` to `app_config.yaml` and configure**:
    ```yaml
    bucket_name: your-bucket-name
    ss_urls:
        - ss://method:password@server:port
    ```

## Usage

1. **Add your Shadowsocks URLs to the `ss_urls` list in `app_config.yaml`**:
    ```yaml
    ss_urls:
        - ss://method:password@server:port
    ```

2. **Upload configurations**:
    ```bash
    python upload_configs.py
    ```

    The script will output the public URLs for both configurations.

## Development

- **Python 3.6+**
- Uses `ruamel.yaml` for YAML handling.
- Uses `google-cloud-storage` for GCS operations.
