## Image Class

You can apply classes to images in Markdown like this:

```markdown
{: .centered }
![](assets/images/pin/pin.jpg){: .responsive }
*Source: Telegram*{: .caption }
```

This will render the image with the specified classes:

{: .centered }  
![](assets/images/pin/pin.jpg){: .responsive }
