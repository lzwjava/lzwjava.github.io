title: Api Usage Of Deepseek And Mistral
---

## DeepSeek

In one month, 15 million tokens cost me approximately 23.5 CNY.

This was my usage in one day:

| Type              | Tokens    |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Input (Cache Hit)  | 946,816   |
| Input (Cache Miss) | 2,753,752 |
| Output            | 3,100,977 |

The calculation is as follows:

0.94 * 0.1 + 2.75 * 1 + 3.10 * 2 = 11.83

So, depending on the task, the token usage largely depends on the input (cache miss) and output.

This result aligns with the expected cost.

## Mistral


The pricing for Mistral models is as follows:

| Model                 | Input (USD per million tokens) |  Output (USD per million tokens) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `mistral-large-2411`  | 2                            | 6                               |
| `mistral-small-latest`| 0.2                          | 0.6                             |

In one day, my Mistral account usage was as follows (Model: `mistral-large-2411`):

| Type   | Tokens  | Cost (USD) |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Total  | 772,284 | 3.44       |
| Output | 474,855 | 2.85       |
| Input  | 297,429 | 0.59       |


For the `mistral-small-2409` model, the total usage was 1,022,407 tokens.

Assuming 1/3 of these were input tokens and 2/3 were output tokens:

There were 340,802 input tokens and 681,605 output tokens.

Therefore, the total cost is calculated as 340,802 * 0.2 / 1,000,000 + 681,605 * 0.6 / 1,000,000 = 0.07 + 0.41 = 0.48 USD.

The Mistral console reports a total usage cost of 0.43 USD, which approximately matches our calculation.

## Grok

| Model         | Input (USD per million tokens) | Output (USD per million tokens) |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `grok-2-latest` | 2                            | 10                              |
