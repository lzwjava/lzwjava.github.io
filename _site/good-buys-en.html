<h3 id="royalstar-dryer-378-cny">Royalstar Dryer, 378 CNY</h3>

<p>Living in the south of China is a bit painful because the clothes can’t dry up on wet days. So I tried to solve this problem. I once bought a big dryer, like the below one. It is a portable closet plus a dryer machine on the bottom. It can contain a lot of clothes inside the closet. You can dry them in two hours.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/big.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>However, the disadvantage is that it is too large. So when I moved out of my parent’s house and rent a small room, I found that I couldn’t buy that product to solve the problem anymore. Because 4 guys share a house of 100 square meters size. And my room is just 8 square meters and there is not much space in the shared living room and balcony. So I found this small dryer, Royalstar Dryer. It just cost me 378 CNY to order in Pinduoduo.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/royalstar.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>The user experience is wonderful. The capacity is suitable for one person and it just occupies a small place. The bottom size is 38cm * 38cm， just like the bottom size of a rice cooker. And its height is 74cm, just like the length of the arm when you spread it.</p>

<p>I don’t use it to dry my clothes directly after the washing machine finished washing them. I will hang up them. And on the second day, when I want to take a shower, then I go to pick up my clothes. If I find some of them still wet in some parts of the cloth, then I will put them in the dryer. And turn the program to the outerwear level, and set a timer of 1 hour. And I just go to get my other clothes to wear temporarily. After taking my shower and waiting some moments, then the clothes will be dried up. So I can dress my favorite clothes again.</p>

<p>I know dryers are popular in the western country. However, that kind of dryer is just like the washing machine. It is big. Whatever, Royalstar Dryer is my best buy this year.</p>

<h3 id="myopic-sunglasses-68-cny">Myopic Sunglasses, 68 CNY</h3>

<p>I once shared that I bought my myopic glasses in Pinduoduo with only a little money. This time, it turns to sunglasses. I bought a pair of the below kind. The right lens is 500 myopia degrees and 175 astigmatism degrees. The left lens is 275 myopia degrees and 200 astigmatism degrees. It cost me 68 CNY.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/glasses.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>I use it most of the daytime when I drive my car. It is too comfortable wearing it for looking ahead to be unable to leave it. After wearing sunglasses for some time and once you take them off, you will find that the sunlight is very harsh, especially when you are driving.</p>

<h3 id="newest-iphone-around-10000-cny">Newest iPhone, Around 10000 CNY</h3>

<p>When you upgrade your mobile phone, then you notice how fast technology evolves. You play with your new phone and old phone at the same time, then you notice the big difference between them. The most significant difference is that the screen is larger, and so is the phone. The new phone may seem too big. And the next moment you realize that it will seem small when you upgrade the phone after 3 years.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/iphone.jpg" width="400px" /><img /></div>

<p>I love iPhone, just like other billion people in the world. I bought iPhone 14 Pro Max (512G) recently. I have used it for some days. Then I feel more optimistic about the future. And I plan to buy my 1.5 yo daughter the newest iPhone too and help her study English by installing a lot of English apps and games though we live in China. Steve Jobs is right. Every generation grows up with the better things, so they can appreciate the good things. So humans can be better and better.</p>

<p>I began using iPhones in Jan 2015. My first iPhone is the iPhone 6. I upgraded it to iPhone X in 2018. Now, in late 2022, I got my iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>

<h3 id="2-newmine-bluetooth-speaker-total-218-cny">2 Newmine Bluetooth Speaker, Total 218 CNY</h3>

<p>I recently bought 2 Bluetooth speakers. I set them up in my room and play lectures or music on them at the same time. They used a technology called TWS, True Wireless Stereo. This technology allows them to pair with each other via Bluetooth. So you can hear the sound from them at the same time. It is amazing.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/speaker.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>I remember that I try to use Mac to reach the same effect. I use Mac to connect some speakers. I use software to let the sound play in these Bluetooth speakers at the same time. However, it is not convenient. Because nowadays, most of the content is easier to be accessed via mobile phone. So if we can use our phone to play songs with two speakers to make music float around our room, then how good life is.</p>

<h3 id="monqiqi-on-ear-headphone-188-cny">MonQiQi On-ear Headphone, 188 CNY</h3>

<p>Not only the speaker can use the technology TWS, but also the headphone. MonQiQi on-ear headphone buds used TWS to pair each other. This kind of on-ear headphones is different from the kind of in-ear headphones. So you can listen to others carefully while listening to the headphone at the same time.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/headphone.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>In recent half a year, I learned English so hard that I become a little crazy. I try to listen to English lectures all my awake time. However, the AirPods alike headphone avoid me from doing so. Because I have to talk with my family and colleagues for some time in a day. So I found this solution to fix this problem. And it works like a charm.</p>

<p>Originally, I bought another kind of on-ear headphones, the below one. However, I found its audio quality poor. I was lucky that I bought the proper headphone on my second attempt.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/pisen.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<h3 id="neta-v-400-lite-86900-cny">Neta V 400 Lite, 86900 CNY</h3>

<p>New energy vehicles are hot in 2022. It is probably the turning point year in the new energy vehicle history. I also bought one two months ago.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/netav.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>I need to write another long article to share its advantages and disadvantages. There are two perspectives, one is comparing it to gasoline vehicles, and another is comparing it to other new energy vehicles.</p>

<p>To be short, driving new energy vehicles is free. You will not worry about the refueling cost anymore. Do you want to go far to visit a friend? Do you want to do some random road trip? Just go. Never worry about the refueling cost. It is wonderful. The electricity cost is just approximately one-tenth of the gas cost. My previous car is Volkswagen Polo 2010. It costs me 300 CNY to refuel and it can run for 400 KM. Now, It costs me 30 CNY to fully charge the Neta car to run 400 KM.</p>

<p>And in the second main difference, the new energy vehicles don’t need to operate the engine when they stand still. So for 2 hours, you take a rest in the car and you open the air condition all the time, its electricity power just drops down 2%. And it has a big battery in the car. So it is convenient to output the power when you need it. So you can fetch the power to lift off your lamps when you go camping outside.</p>

<p>Regarding its disadvantages, Neta V doesn’t have an English language setting option. And you can’t install apps freely and you just have a few apps. Though it is enough to use in daily routine, however, the experience is not rich. I want to play my Youtube videos on the car computer. I want to see World Cup Soccer Games in my car.</p>

<h3 id="changdi-electric-oven-479-cny">Changdi Electric Oven, 479 CNY</h3>

<p>My wife bought it. If it turns to me to buy the electric oven, I will buy the product whose price is around 200 CNY. However, it deserves such regarding its position in my recent years of life.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/buys/oven.jpg" width="250px" /><img /></div>

<p>I tried many ways to cook beginning in 2019, using a frying pan, using a microwave oven, using an electric oven and using other electric kitchen appliances. I even once went to a nearby wasteland to cook with dry leaves.</p>

<p>However, there is only one way to last until today. This is the electric oven way. It is so easy that you don’t think cooking waste your time. I do the most basic cooking, just heat the food.</p>

<p>I like to heat up dried squids, beef meatballs, Xiangjiang Naan bread, hot dogs, chicken wings, beef, etc. And most of the time, I don’t need to spread the sauce before putting the food into the oven. Like the dried squid, when it is finished heating, I just glued it with soy sauce, then it is delicious.</p>

<p>Regarding cooking, the ingredients are the most important. Regarding the sauce, a few are enough. This is my simple cooking philosophy.</p>

<p>So following this philosophy, I can cook good meals for some days in a week. I don’t need to do it to save money. It is just a hobby and it is satisfying per se.</p>
