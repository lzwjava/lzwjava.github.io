<h2 id="hsbc-debit-card-retention-incident">HSBC Debit Card Retention Incident</h2>

<p>I got my HSBC Debit card in May 2023 at the Sha Tin branch in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, just at the ATM outside the branch, my card was retained.</p>

<p>After learning some basic operations, I was going to take back my card from the machine. However, my daughter was playing and wanting to touch that card. Suddenly, the card was retained.</p>

<p>So this is in July 2025. I used WhatsApp to chat with HSBC first. Later, I was told to use the HSBC HK app to talk with them.</p>

<p>They told me something like:</p>

<hr />

<p>Thank you for your patience, Mr. Li. After checking, we found that there is an ATM card in your name with a card production record on May 19, 2023. If you have not received this card, we can report it lost and reissue a new card for you.</p>

<p>Do you need us to report it lost and reissue a new card for you?</p>

<p>Okay. We’ve processed your instruction and your card is deactivated.</p>

<p>There are a few things you can do or take note of in the meantime to secure your money and assets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We suggest you check the transaction history via online banking or the HSBC HK app instantly to confirm if there is any unauthorized transaction after you lost the card—if yes, please contact us for further help.</li>
  <li>Your account number will remain unchanged—we recommend changing the PIN on your replacement ATM card once you’ve received it, even if your current PIN still works (you can do this at any of our ATM machines).</li>
  <li>You won’t need to register for our Payment by Phone Service (PPS) again if your lost ATM card has done it.</li>
  <li>If the card you lost had a signature on it, please visit your nearest branch to change the signature associated with your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our ATM cards are sent by normal mail. There is no tracking number.</p>

<p>Generally, it takes within a week to mail to a Hong Kong address, and for overseas addresses, it takes 7-11 working days, depending on the mailing time.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope this time we can do it. Let’s wait for the new card.</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="assets/images/hsbc/h1.jpg" alt="" class="responsive" />

<hr />

<p>I received the card around August 14, 2025. It was great. I tried two HSBC ATM machines in Guangzhou: one at Taikoo Hui and one at Tianhe City. I started learning the details of the product and how to use it effectively to help my life. I also tried to apply for the HSBC World Debit Card.</p>

<p>The card I received is called the HSBC UnionPay Debit Card. However, when I went to a 7-Eleven store to buy a drink, I tried several times with the help of the staff, but we couldn’t successfully use my HSBC UnionPay Debit Card. I still don’t know the reason. Later, I increased the limits in the app. I will try again at another time.</p>
