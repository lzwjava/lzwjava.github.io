  <li>Applied to Y Combinator twice. One time, entered the second round with around a 3% acceptance rate, though didn’t make it into the batch.</li>
  <li>Like to initiate new ideas in big companies to actually help the project; tried many ways and created proofs-of-concept in local development in some code branches. Presented them to tech leads to move things forward. Some received good feedback.</li>
  <li>Gained a lot of social media influencing practice, including blogging, WeChat Subscription Channel, TikTok, WeChat Videos, Weibo and LinkedIn. Acquired thousands of followers in several accounts or 60k page views a year.</li>
  <li>Used 3 mobile phones at the same time and thousands of apps and games to experiment with, including different kinds of apps from tens of countries.</li>
  <li>As an early user of Blue Sky, I commented on Jeff Dean’s first post here and got a like from him; he is Google’s Chief Scientist.</li>
  <li>Own hundreds of small tools and gadgets, such as an Electric/Magnetic Fields meter, telescope etc. And bring them while traveling to discover their potential in different scenarios.</li>
  <li>If things or products are cheap, very willing to buy different kinds to compare and understand their nuances.</li>
  <li>Read around 100 books about business, management, and product. Have some connections with people who are experts in these areas.</li>
  <li>As a crypto and US stock investor since 2018, I took a break due to some losses but resumed investing in 2024, using long-term and regular investing practices.
