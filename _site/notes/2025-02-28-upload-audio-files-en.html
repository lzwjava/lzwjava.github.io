  <h3 id="key-points">Key Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to upload audio files to YouTube programmatically by converting them to video files and using the YouTube API, suitable for batch uploads like 100 audios.</li>
  <li>For Spotify, there is no public API for uploading audio files; distribution services like DistroKid are needed, but they lack public APIs for automation.</li>
  <li>Research suggests YouTube allows podcast uploads as videos with static images, while Spotify requires manual uploads through their platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="youtube-upload-process">YouTube Upload Process</h3>
<p>You can upload audio files to YouTube by first converting them into video files, such as MP4, with a static image using tools like FFmpeg. Then, use the YouTube Data API to automate the upload process, which is ideal for batch uploads of 100 audios. This method works for podcasts by creating videos from audio episodes, often with a static image like show art.</p>

<h3 id="spotify-upload-limitations">Spotify Upload Limitations</h3>
<p>For Spotify, there is no public API available for uploading audio files directly. Instead, you would need to use a distribution service like DistroKid, which distributes to Spotify but does not offer a public API for external developers to automate uploads. This means batch uploads via script are not feasible for Spotify.</p>

<h3 id="unexpected-detail">Unexpected Detail</h3>
<p>An unexpected detail is that while YouTube accepts audio as video files, Spotify’s ecosystem relies on manual uploads or third-party services without public API access, limiting automation options.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="survey-note-detailed-analysis-of-audio-file-uploads-to-youtube-and-spotify">Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Audio File Uploads to YouTube and Spotify</h3>

<p>This analysis explores the feasibility of uploading audio files to YouTube and Spotify programmatically, particularly for batch uploads of 100 audios, as requested. The focus is on understanding the technical and practical implications for both platforms, drawing from available documentation and platform policies as of February 28, 2025.</p>

<h4 id="youtube-programmatic-uploads-and-podcast-integration">YouTube: Programmatic Uploads and Podcast Integration</h4>

<p>YouTube provides a robust API, specifically the YouTube Data API, which supports video uploads. However, since YouTube primarily handles video content, audio files must be converted into a video format to be uploaded. This process involves using tools like FFmpeg to combine the audio file with a static image, creating a video file (e.g., MP4) that YouTube can process. This method is particularly relevant for podcast uploads, where each episode can be represented as a video with a static image, such as the podcast’s show art.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The YouTube Data API’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">videos.insert</code> method allows for programmatic uploads, enabling automation for batch processing. For instance, a script can iterate through 100 audio files, convert each to a video, and upload them using the API. Documentation indicates that uploaded files must conform to specific constraints, such as file size and format, and require authorization with OAuth 2.0 for access ([Upload a Video</td>
      <td>YouTube Data API</td>
      <td>Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video)). This approach is feasible for podcasts, as YouTube automatically classifies playlists as podcasts when set up, and episodes are treated as videos.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For podcast creators, submitting an RSS feed to YouTube can automate the process, where YouTube creates videos from audio episodes using show art. However, for direct API uploads, the conversion step is necessary, and the API supports setting metadata like titles, descriptions, and privacy status, enhancing usability for batch uploads.</p>

<h4 id="spotify-lack-of-public-api-for-uploads">Spotify: Lack of Public API for Uploads</h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>In contrast, Spotify does not offer a public API for uploading audio files, whether for music or podcast episodes. The Spotify Web API is designed for retrieving metadata, managing playlists, and controlling playback, not for content submission ([Web API</td>
      <td>Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)). For podcasters, Spotify for Creators provides a user interface for uploading episodes, supporting formats like MP3, M4A, and WAV, but this is manual and not scriptable (<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/creators/article/publishing-audio-episodes/">Publishing audio episodes - Spotify</a>).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For musicians, distribution services like DistroKid, TuneCore, and Record Union facilitate uploads to Spotify, but these services do not provide public APIs for external developers. Research into DistroKid’s documentation and support center revealed no mention of APIs for batch uploads, indicating that automation is not supported (<a href="https://support.distrokid.com/hc/en-us">DistroKid Help Center</a>). This limitation is significant for batch uploads, as users must rely on the platform’s web interface, which is impractical for 100 audios.</p>

<p>An interesting observation is the existence of unofficial API wrappers, such as a Golang wrapper for DistroKid on GitHub, suggesting reverse-engineering efforts. However, these are not official and may violate terms of service, making them unreliable for production use (<a href="https://github.com/topics/distrokid">distrokid · GitHub Topics · GitHub</a>).</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>Supports Programmatic Uploads</th>
      <th>API Availability</th>
      <th>Batch Upload Feasibility</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>YouTube</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Public (YouTube Data API)</td>
      <td>Yes, with conversion to video</td>
      <td>Requires FFmpeg for audio-to-video conversion, suitable for podcasts as videos</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spotify</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>No public API for uploads</td>
      <td>No, manual through UI or distribution services</td>
      <td>Relies on services like DistroKid, no automation for external developers</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For YouTube, the process involves converting audio to video, which can be automated using scripts. For example, a Python script can use FFmpeg to create videos and the YouTube API to upload them, handling metadata like titles and descriptions. This is particularly effective for podcasts, where YouTube’s podcast feature treats episodes as videos in a playlist, enhancing discoverability.</p>

<p>For Spotify, the absence of a public upload API means users must use distribution services, which lack automation features for external scripts. This is a significant barrier for batch uploads, as manual uploads through Spotify for Creators or distribution platforms are time-consuming and not scalable for 100 audios.</p>

<h4 id="unexpected-findings-and-considerations">Unexpected Findings and Considerations</h4>

<p>An unexpected finding is the reliance on third-party services for Spotify uploads, which do not offer public APIs, contrasting with YouTube’s open API approach. This highlights a difference in platform strategies, with YouTube favoring developer accessibility and Spotify prioritizing controlled distribution. Additionally, the need for audio-to-video conversion for YouTube adds a technical step, but it’s manageable with tools like FFmpeg, which is widely available and free.</p>

<p>For users, this means planning for YouTube involves technical setup for conversion and API integration, while Spotify requires manual effort or reliance on distribution services, potentially incurring costs (e.g., DistroKid’s $22.99/year for unlimited uploads). The batch upload of 100 audios is feasible for YouTube but not for Spotify via script, impacting workflow efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>In summary, uploading audio files to YouTube programmatically is possible and suitable for batch uploads by converting to video and using the YouTube API. For Spotify, there is no public API for uploads, limiting automation to manual processes or distribution services without scriptable APIs. This analysis underscores the importance of platform-specific strategies for content distribution, with YouTube offering more flexibility for developers and Spotify maintaining a closed ecosystem for uploads.</p>
