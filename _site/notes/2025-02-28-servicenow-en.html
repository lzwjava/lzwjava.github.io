<h3 id="comprehensive-guide-on-using-servicenow">Comprehensive Guide on Using ServiceNow</h3>

<p>This guide provides an in-depth look at using ServiceNow, a platform designed to streamline IT and business processes for organizations. It covers access methods, navigation, common tasks, and best practices, ensuring end-users can effectively utilize the system. The information is based on general practices and official documentation, acknowledging that organizational customizations may affect specific experiences.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-to-servicenow">Introduction to ServiceNow</h4>
<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that automates and manages IT services, human resources, customer service, and more, enhancing efficiency and user satisfaction. For end-users, it primarily serves as a tool for reporting issues, requesting services, and accessing self-help resources. The platform’s interface and features can vary depending on the organization’s configuration, so this guide aims to cover general usage while encouraging users to consult internal documentation for specifics.</p>

<h4 id="accessing-servicenow">Accessing ServiceNow</h4>
<p>To begin, users typically access ServiceNow through a web browser by navigating to the URL provided by their organization. This URL directs to the organization’s instance of the ServiceNow portal, where users log in using their assigned credentials (username and password).</p>

<p>An additional access method is the ServiceNow mobile app, which enhances flexibility for end-users. The platform offers two main mobile apps: <strong>Now Mobile</strong> for end-users and <strong>Mobile Agent</strong> for service desk agents. Now Mobile, available for iOS and Android, allows users to find answers, submit requests, and manage workflows across departments like IT, HR, and Facilities (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.servicenow.requestor&amp;hl=en_US">Now Mobile</a>). However, the availability and configuration of the mobile app depend on the organization’s setup, so users should check with their IT department for access instructions and compatibility, especially noting that it requires at least the ServiceNow Rome instance or later.</p>

<p>Security is paramount; users should keep their login credentials confidential and not share their accounts with others to protect sensitive data. Regularly updating contact information in the user profile ensures smooth communication and ticket management.</p>

<h4 id="navigating-the-interface">Navigating the Interface</h4>
<p>Once logged in, the ServiceNow interface presents a user-friendly layout, typically featuring a navigation menu on the left or top. This menu provides access to key sections, which may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Home</strong>: A personalized dashboard displaying open tickets, recent activities, and announcements.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Catalog</strong>: A collection of available services and products users can request, such as new hardware, software, or HR services.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident Management</strong>: For reporting and tracking IT issues or outages affecting work.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge Base</strong>: An online library of articles and solutions for self-service troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The interface’s appearance and functionality can vary based on the ServiceNow version and organizational customizations. For instance, older versions like Eureka (2015) featured UI14, while newer releases like Washington DC (2024) and upcoming Xanadu (late 2024) offer updated designs. Users should familiarize themselves with their organization’s specific layout, possibly through internal training or documentation.</p>

<h4 id="common-tasks-for-end-users">Common Tasks for End-Users</h4>
<p>End-users primarily interact with ServiceNow for reporting incidents and requesting services. Here’s a detailed breakdown:</p>

<h5 id="reporting-an-incident">Reporting an Incident</h5>
<p>To report an IT issue, navigate to the Incident Management module via the navigation menu. Click “New” to create an incident, then fill out the form with details such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A description of the issue.</li>
  <li>The category (e.g., hardware, software, network).</li>
  <li>Priority level, if applicable.</li>
  <li>Any additional information, like screenshots or error messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit the form, and a ticket number will be generated for tracking. Users can add comments or attachments later to provide updates or clarify details, facilitating communication with the support team.</p>

<h5 id="requesting-a-service">Requesting a Service</h5>
<p>For new services or products, use the Service Catalog. Search for the desired service (e.g., requesting a laptop, setting up a workspace) and follow the prompts to complete the request. The catalog may include forms for additional details, and once submitted, the request is routed to the appropriate department for fulfillment.</p>

<h5 id="checking-ticket-status">Checking Ticket Status</h5>
<p>To monitor progress, users can view open tickets on their Home page, which often displays a list of active incidents and requests. Alternatively, use the search function to find specific tickets by ticket number or description. The status (e.g., In Progress, Resolved) and any updates from the support team are typically visible, allowing users to stay informed.</p>

<h5 id="communication-and-updates">Communication and Updates</h5>
<p>ServiceNow facilitates communication through the ticket system, where users can add comments or attach files to provide additional information. The platform often sends email notifications for updates, such as status changes or requests for more details. Users should regularly check these emails and respond promptly to ensure smooth resolution.</p>

<h5 id="self-service-and-knowledge-base">Self-Service and Knowledge Base</h5>
<p>The Knowledge Base is a valuable resource for self-service, offering articles and guides on common issues, such as resetting passwords or troubleshooting software. Users can search the Knowledge Base from the navigation menu to find solutions, potentially resolving issues without needing to submit a ticket, thus reducing wait times and support load.</p>

<h4 id="best-practices-for-end-users">Best Practices for End-Users</h4>
<p>To maximize the effectiveness of ServiceNow, consider the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Keep login credentials secure and avoid sharing accounts to protect sensitive data and comply with organizational policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Profile Maintenance</strong>: Regularly update contact information in your user profile to ensure accurate communication for ticket updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Provide feedback on your experience, as organizations often use this to improve the platform, enhancing user satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Training</strong>: Participate in any provided training sessions to better understand the platform’s features, reducing frustration and improving efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Refer to organization-specific documentation for detailed instructions, as customizations may affect how features work.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organizational-variations-and-support">Organizational Variations and Support</h4>
<p>It’s important to note that ServiceNow implementations vary widely. Organizations may customize modules, rename sections, or add specific workflows, so the exact steps might differ from this guide. For example, some may use SharePoint forms for certain requests alongside ServiceNow, as seen in some implementations (<a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/servicenow-user-guide">Mass.gov ServiceNow User Guide</a>). Users unsure about any aspect should contact their IT department or consult internal resources, such as help desks or knowledge bases, for tailored guidance.</p>

<h4 id="historical-context-and-versioning">Historical Context and Versioning</h4>
<p>ServiceNow releases updates twice yearly, named after cities (e.g., Washington DC, Xanadu), with each bringing new features and interface improvements. Older versions, like Eureka (2015) with UI14, are less common now, and current versions like Washington DC (Q2 2024) offer enhanced mobile and AI capabilities. This evolution ensures the platform remains relevant, but users should verify their instance’s version for compatibility, especially for mobile app usage.</p>

<h4 id="tables-for-clarity">Tables for Clarity</h4>
<p>Below is a table summarizing key modules and their purposes, based on general practices:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Module</strong></th>
