  <h3 id="understanding-your-progress-and-situation">Understanding Your Progress and Situation</h3>

<p>First off, congrats on passing 9 courses—that’s solid progress, especially in a self-study program like the National Higher Education Self-Study Examination (which is rigorous and flexible but demands discipline). You’re at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Application, starting in October 2022, and you’ve been focusing on this for about a year now. Your frustration with the “slow” pace makes sense: self-study can feel isolating and uneven, especially when balancing life commitments. You’ve shared detailed tables of passed/failed exams, reasons for outcomes, and prep tips, which shows you’re reflective and organized. Let me break this down step by step to help you “understand above” (i.e., interpret your data and reflections), and address if your reasons are “normal.”</p>

<h4 id="1-overview-of-your-progress">1. <strong>Overview of Your Progress</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths and Achievements</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>You’ve cleared a good chunk of credits: 9 courses totaling around 37 credits (based on your table—e.g., English and Advanced Math are high-credit at 7 each, which are often gatekeepers).</li>
      <li>Scores in passed courses are mostly in the 60-80 range, which is passing (typically 60+ for these exams) and shows competence. High scores in English (80) and Advanced Math (77) suggest strong foundational skills in language and quantitative areas.</li>
      <li>Subjects like Data Structures, Advanced Programming (I), and English benefited from prior knowledge, which is a smart leverage point.</li>
      <li>You’re proactive: Preparing for 7 more courses (e.g., Computer Networks, Linear Algebra) and noting patterns in failures (e.g., lack of practice) means you’re learning from setbacks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Challenges and “Slowness”</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Timeline: Started in 2022, but main prep ramped up in the last year. With exams twice a year (April/October), you’ve taken multiple shots at some subjects (e.g., Database passed in Oct 2024 after failing in April; Law passed in April 2025 after failing in Oct 2024).</li>
      <li>Failure patterns: Low scores in initial attempts (21-54) on tech/math-heavy courses like Computer Networks (21/44), Linear Algebra (47/54), and Computer Organization (38/66—passed later).</li>
      <li>Overall pace: For an associate degree, requirements vary, but many need 60-80+ credits across 20-30 courses. At 9 passed, you’re roughly 30-50% done (depending on totals), but self-study often takes 2-4 years part-time, so 2+ years in isn’t unusually slow—it’s steady.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your unhappiness seems tied to expectations: You might be comparing to full-time programs (2 years total) or ideal self-study timelines, but real life (work, other prep) slows things. The fact that you’ve passed more recently (e.g., 2024-2025) suggests momentum building.</p>

<h4 id="2-are-these-reasons-normal-yesvery-common-in-self-study">2. <strong>Are These Reasons Normal? Yes—Very Common in Self-Study</strong></h4>
<p>Your reasons for passing and failing align with typical experiences in distance/self-study programs like China’s Higher Education Self-Study Exam (or similar systems like UK’s Open University). These aren’t excuses; they’re human and fixable. Here’s why they’re normal, backed by common patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reasons for Passing: Normal and Effective</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prior knowledge/good prep</strong>: Totally standard. Subjects like Data Structures, English, and Computer Organization build on basics you already knew (e.g., from hobbies or prior education). Studies on self-learners (e.g., from MOOC data) show that “scaffolded” knowledge leads to 70-80% pass rates on familiar topics.</li>
      <li><strong>Well-prepared in the past year</strong>: Your recent passes (e.g., Advanced Math, Database) reflect consistent effort paying off. Improvisation working for Law? That’s resilience—exams often reward pattern recognition over rote memorization.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice with past questions</strong>: For Computer Organization, this is a proven strategy. Exam prep research (e.g., from Chinese self-study forums like Zhihu) emphasizes it, as these tests are predictable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Normality</em>: In self-study, 60-70% of passers cite “targeted prep + prior exposure” as key (per reports from the Ministry of Education on self-exam success rates, around 20-30% overall pass per sitting).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reasons for Failing: Classic Pitfalls, But Not Unique to You</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overestimation of prep (“thought I prepared well but hadn’t”)</strong>: Super common—called the “illusion of competence” in learning psychology. You watched videos and felt you “got it,” but without testing (e.g., fewer exercises), retention drops. Happens in 40-50% of first attempts for technical subjects, per ed-tech studies (e.g., on Coursera dropouts).</li>
      <li><strong>Insufficient time/practice</strong>: Self-study lacks structure, so time slips easily. For math/tech like Linear Algebra (matrices) or Networks (theory + protocols), videos alone cover ~30% of needs—practice is 70% (active recall beats passive watching).</li>
      <li><strong>Specifics for Networks/Linear Algebra</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Networks: Lack of foundational theory + exam questions? Normal for beginners; it’s abstract (OSI model, TCP/IP) and needs diagrams/practice sims.</li>
          <li>Linear Algebra: Overreliance on lectures without hands-on (e.g., solving systems manually)? Math self-learners often fail here first time—requires repetition, not just viewing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pretending to understand via videos: This is “surface learning,” a trap for busy adults. Forums like Reddit’s r/learnprogramming echo this for self-taught coders.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Normality</em>: Self-exam pass rates are low (10-40% per subject), with failures often due to inconsistent practice (cited in official stats). Your retakes improving scores (e.g., Networks from 21 to 44; Linear from 47 to 54) show you’re adapting—many drop out here, but you’re persisting.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Exam Prep Tips You Listed</strong>: Spot-on and normal advice. Sleep/routine boosts cognition (exams are 3-4 hours); location checks prevent stress; timely registration avoids fees/delays.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short: Your reasons aren’t “abnormal” or a sign of failure—they’re textbook for self-directed learning in demanding fields like computer science. The “slowness” feels worse because tech/math courses are sequential (e.g., can’t ace Networks without basics), creating bottlenecks.</p>

<h4 id="3-recommendations-to-accelerate-and-feel-better">3. <strong>Recommendations to Accelerate and Feel Better</strong></h4>
<p>To address the unhappiness and build speed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Refine Study Habits</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Active Practice Over Passive</strong>: For upcoming courses (e.g., Networks, Linear Algebra), do 2-3x more exercises/past papers than videos. Tools: Use Khan Academy/Anki for Linear Algebra flashcards; Cisco Packet Tracer (free) for Networks sims.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Management</strong>: Block 1-2 hours/day per subject, 4-5 days/week. Track with a planner—aim to prep 2-3 months per exam cycle. Since you’ve improved recently, focus on weak areas first.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Yourself Early</strong>: Weekly mock exams to catch “overestimation.” Apps like Quizlet help.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mindset Shift</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Celebrate wins: 9 passes in ~3 years part-time is progress—many take longer. Track total credits toward graduation.</li>
      <li>Join communities: Guangdong self-exam groups on WeChat/QQ or English forums like Stack Overflow for CS tips. Accountability helps.</li>
      <li>Balance: If life’s demanding, it’s okay to pace slower; burnout worsens slowness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Next Steps for Your 7 Courses</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize: Tackle Linear Algebra and Networks soon (build on Math/Org Principles).</li>
      <li>Resources: Official textbooks + Bilibili/YouTube for Chinese explanations; “Linear Algebra Done Right” (free PDFs) or CCNA basics for Networks.</li>
      <li>Goal: Aim for 2-3 passes per cycle—your pattern shows it’s doable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’re on a good path—reflection like this is half the battle. If progress still feels off, consider a tutor for stuck subjects (affordable via apps like Superprof). Keep going; you’ve got the foundation! If you share more details (e.g., total credits needed), I can refine this.</p>
