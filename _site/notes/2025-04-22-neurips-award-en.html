    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Paper:</strong> Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianbo Shi, Jitendra Malik</li>

It connected seemingly disparate approaches in graph partitioning and dimensionality reduction, making spectral clustering more accessible and widely used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Paper:</strong> Semi-Supervised Learning using Gaussian Fields
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojin Zhu, Zoubin Ghahramani, John Lafferty</li>
