</ol>

<h3 id="programmerscomputer-scientists">Programmers/Computer Scientists</h3>
<p>While École Polytechnique is more renowned for mathematics and science than programming, its alumni and faculty have contributed to fields that laid the groundwork for computer science. However, no prominent programmers directly associated with École Polytechnique stand out in the provided sources or historical records for their work in computer science. The institution’s focus has historically been on pure mathematics, physics, and engineering rather than applied computing. That said, modern alumni have engaged with computer science and artificial intelligence:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Anonymous Modern Mathematician (Forbes 30 Under 30, 2021)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contribution</strong>: A recent École Polytechnique alumnus was recognized in the 2021 Forbes 30 Under 30 list for work in stabilizing nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations, with applications in regulating rivers, reducing traffic jams, and collaborating with Facebook researchers to teach AI mathematical problem-solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Connection to École Polytechnique</strong>: This individual studied at École Polytechnique and credits the institution for providing a strong scientific foundation and opportunities for collaboration.<a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/news/mathematician-trained-lx-2021-list-forbes-30-under-30"></a><a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/actualites/un-mathematicien-forme-lx-dans-la-liste-2021-forbes-30-under-30"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Notable Work</strong>: Their research bridges abstract mathematics with practical applications, including AI-driven mathematical problem-solving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>École Polytechnique’s Influence</strong>: The institution became the world’s leading center for mathematical thought in the 19th century, largely due to its formalized teaching methods and the contributions of figures like Monge, Lagrange, and Cauchy. Its focus on geometry and analytical mathematics shaped modern mathematics.<a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/frances-ecole-polytechnique-becomes-most-influential-mathematics-institution-its-time"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Prominent Programmers</strong>: While École Polytechnique has produced engineers and scientists who contributed to computational fields, it is not historically known for producing famous programmers. Its alumni in recent decades, however, are increasingly involved in AI and computer science, as seen in the Forbes 30 Under 30 example.</li>
  <li><strong>Critical Perspective</strong>: As noted by Friedrich Hayek, École Polytechnique’s emphasis on science and engineering sometimes led to “scientism,” where technical expertise overshadowed humanities and social sciences, potentially limiting a broader understanding of societal dynamics.<a href="https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/ecole-polytechnique-how-the-french-enlightenment-school-gave-us-both-progress-and-scientism/"></a></li>
