  <p>Okay, here are some other companies and startups that could be considered “hidden champions” in today’s world, keeping in mind the broader interpretation of the term:</p>

<p><strong>In Technology &amp; Software:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ASML (Netherlands):</strong> While increasingly known, ASML is the undisputed leader in photolithography systems, crucial for manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips. They have a near-monopoly in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography, making them indispensable to the entire electronics industry. Their profile outside the tech manufacturing world might still be lower than their immense importance.</li>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow (USA):</strong> This cloud-based platform company provides workflow automation solutions for enterprises. While publicly traded and growing in recognition, their deep penetration within large organizations and critical role in IT service management and beyond might not be fully appreciated by the general public.</li>
  <li><strong>Globant (Argentina/Global):</strong> This IT and software development company has quietly grown into a global player, providing services to major corporations. They have a strong reputation for their technical expertise and agile methodologies but often operate behind the scenes for their clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Qualtrics (USA):</strong> Acquired by SAP but still operating somewhat independently, Qualtrics is a leader in experience management software, helping companies gather and analyze customer and employee feedback. Their platform is critical for many businesses but might not be a household name.</li>
  <li><strong>Infineon Technologies (Germany):</strong> A major player in semiconductors for automotive, industrial, and power applications. While a large company, their focus on business-to-business sales in crucial but less consumer-facing industries keeps their general profile relatively lower.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In Manufacturing &amp; Industrials:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Voith (Germany):</strong> A diversified industrial group with leading positions in hydropower, paper machine technology, and marine propulsion systems. They are a global leader in their specific sectors but might not have widespread consumer brand recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Krones (Germany):</strong> A dominant player in packaging machinery for the beverage and liquid food industries. Their equipment is essential for countless consumer products, but the company itself operates behind the scenes of the brands we know.</li>
  <li><strong>SMC Corporation (Japan):</strong> The world’s largest manufacturer of pneumatic and automation components. Their products are vital for industrial automation across various sectors but are not directly consumer-facing.</li>
  <li><strong>Endress+Hauser (Switzerland/Global):</strong> A global leader in process and laboratory measurement technology, providing sensors, instruments, and solutions for various industries. Their expertise is critical for efficiency and safety in complex industrial processes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In Consumer-Facing but Less High-Profile:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Costco Wholesale (USA):</strong> While a major retailer, Costco often operates with a lower advertising profile compared to traditional supermarkets. Their membership-based model and focus on value have led to immense success and customer loyalty, often through word-of-mouth.</li>
  <li><strong>Aldi and Lidl (Germany/Global):</strong> These discount supermarket chains have achieved massive global success through a low-price, no-frills approach. Their limited product range and focus on efficiency might give them a lower profile than traditional supermarkets with extensive marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Shein (China/Global):</strong> This online fast-fashion retailer has experienced explosive growth with a unique, data-driven model and a massive selection. Despite its size and impact, its business practices and supply chain have kept it somewhat out of mainstream positive press in many Western markets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Startups with High Potential (Currently Lower Profile):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Northvolt (Sweden):</strong> A battery manufacturer focused on sustainable and high-performance lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage. As a key player in the energy transition, they are rapidly growing but might not yet be a household name.</li>
  <li><strong>Impossible Foods/Beyond Meat (USA):</strong> While gaining recognition, these companies in the plant-based meat sector are disrupting a massive industry. Their long-term success and impact on food systems could classify them as hidden champions of the future if they maintain a strong market position without excessive mainstream hype.</li>
  <li><strong>Various “deep tech” startups:</strong> Many startups in areas like quantum computing, advanced materials, and biotechnology are developing groundbreaking technologies with the potential for massive impact but currently operate with a very low public profile. Identifying specific names is challenging due to their early stage and focus on R&amp;D rather than consumer marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to remember that the “hidden” aspect is subjective and can evolve. Some of these companies might become more widely recognized over time due to their continued success and market influence. The key characteristic remains their significant impact and leadership within their specific domains, often without the громкая известность of more consumer-facing brands.</p>

<hr />

<p>Identifying low-profile yet highly successful companies or startups, often referred to as “hidden champions,” involves looking at businesses that excel in their niches, generate significant revenue or impact, but avoid the public spotlight. These companies typically focus on specialized markets, maintain strong financial performance, and prioritize innovation or operational excellence over media attention. Below, I’ll highlight some characteristics of hidden champions, provide examples of such companies (both established firms and startups), and explain why they fit the description, drawing on the concept of hidden champions as popularized by Hermann Simon, as well as insights from the current business landscape in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="characteristics-of-hidden-champions">Characteristics of Hidden Champions</h3>
<p>Hidden champions, as defined by Hermann Simon, are companies that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are among the top three in their market (globally or regionally) or number one on their continent.</li>
  <li>Have revenues typically below $5 billion (though some may exceed this in 2025 due to inflation and market growth).</li>
  <li>Maintain a low public profile, often avoiding mainstream media or consumer-facing branding.</li>
  <li>Excel in niche markets, often in B2B sectors, with a focus on innovation, quality, and customer relationships.</li>
  <li>Are often family-owned or privately held, though some may be publicly traded but still operate discreetly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the query’s focus on Fortune 500 companies and startups in 2025, I’ll explore both established firms within or near the Fortune 500 and emerging startups that fit the hidden champion model.</p>

<h3 id="established-hidden-champions-in-or-near-the-fortune-500">Established Hidden Champions in or Near the Fortune 500</h3>
<p>The Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S. companies by revenue, and while many are household names like Walmart or Apple, some lower-ranked or less visible firms embody the hidden champion ethos. Here are a few examples based on their market dominance, niche focus, and low public profile:<a href="https://us500.com/fortune-500-companies"></a><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/fortune-500-companies/"></a></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>W.W. Grainger, Inc.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Industrial distribution (B2B maintenance, repair, and operations products).</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: Grainger is a Fortune 500 company (ranked ~300-400 in recent years) that supplies tools, equipment, and industrial supplies to businesses worldwide. Despite generating billions in revenue ($16.5 billion in 2023), it remains under the radar for most consumers because it operates in the B2B space. Its focus on logistics, inventory management, and e-commerce platforms like Zoro.com has made it a leader in its niche.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: Employs over 26,000 people and serves millions of businesses with a vast catalog of products. Its consistent growth comes from operational efficiency and a strong digital presence, yet it avoids flashy consumer marketing.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Grainger’s brand is rarely seen in mainstream media, focusing instead on direct business relationships and trade channels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Eldorado Resorts (Caesars Entertainment)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Gaming and hospitality.</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: While Caesars Entertainment is known for its casinos, its subsidiary Eldorado Resorts operates regional gaming properties that are less glamorous than Las Vegas giants but highly profitable. It often ranks in the lower half of the Fortune 500 but dominates regional gaming markets in the U.S. Its acquisition of Caesars in 2020 expanded its reach, yet it maintains a low profile outside gambling circles.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: Generates ~$11 billion in revenue and operates dozens of properties, focusing on local markets rather than global branding.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Unlike Las Vegas-centric brands, Eldorado’s regional focus keeps it out of the consumer spotlight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Graybar Electric Company</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Electrical and telecommunications distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: Graybar, often ranked in the Fortune 500 (~400-500), is a leading distributor of electrical, lighting, and communication products for construction and industrial projects. As an employee-owned company, it prioritizes long-term stability over public visibility. Its niche dominance in supply chain solutions for contractors makes it a backbone of infrastructure projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: ~$10 billion in revenue and a network of over 290 locations, serving clients in construction, energy, and telecom.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Operates primarily in B2B, with minimal consumer-facing presence or media coverage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="startups-as-hidden-champions">Startups as Hidden Champions</h3>
<p>Startups, by their nature, are less likely to appear in the Fortune 500 due to revenue thresholds, but many embody the hidden champion model by dominating niche markets with innovative solutions. Based on trends in 2025 and insights from sources like Forbes’ America’s Best Startup Employers, here are a few examples of low-profile, successful startups:<a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/americas-best-startup-employers/"></a></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Verkada</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Security and surveillance technology.</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: Verkada provides cloud-based security cameras and access control systems for enterprises, schools, and hospitals. It’s a leader in the enterprise security space but remains largely unknown to the general public due to its B2B focus. Its growth has been fueled by demand for integrated, AI-driven security solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: Valued at over $3 billion in recent funding rounds, Verkada serves thousands of organizations globally, with a focus on scalability and ease of use.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Targets enterprise clients, avoiding consumer markets and mainstream media.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Celonis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Process mining and automation.</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: Celonis specializes in software that analyzes and optimizes business processes, helping companies like Siemens and Uber improve efficiency. Despite a valuation exceeding $10 billion, it operates in a niche B2B software market that garners little public attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: Serves over 1,000 enterprise clients and has raised significant funding from top investors like Accel and 83North.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Its focus on backend process optimization means it’s rarely featured in consumer-facing media.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Axonius</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industry</strong>: Cybersecurity and asset management.</li>
      <li><strong>Why a Hidden Champion</strong>: Axonius provides a platform for managing and securing IT assets, addressing the growing complexity of enterprise cybersecurity. It’s a leader in the cybersecurity asset management space but operates quietly, serving IT departments rather than end consumers.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics</strong>: Valued at ~$2.6 billion in 2024, with clients including major corporations and government agencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Profile</strong>: Its technical, enterprise-focused solutions keep it out of the public eye.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-these-companies-are-hidden-champions">Why These Companies Are Hidden Champions</h3>
<p>These companies, whether Fortune 500 players or startups, share traits that align with Hermann Simon’s hidden champion framework:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Niche Market Leadership</strong>: They dominate specialized markets (e.g., industrial distribution, regional gaming, enterprise security) rather than broad consumer markets.</li>
  <li><strong>Global or Regional Reach</strong>: Many operate internationally or lead in specific U.S. regions, yet their focus remains narrow.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation and Quality</strong>: They invest heavily in R&amp;D or operational excellence, like Celonis’ process mining algorithms or Grainger’s e-commerce platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Low Public Profile</strong>: Their B2B focus or regional operations mean they rarely appear in mainstream media, unlike consumer giants like Apple or Amazon.<a href="https://www.growthnavigate.com/fortune-500-companies-list"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenges-in-identifying-hidden-champions-in-2025">Challenges in Identifying Hidden Champions in 2025</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Limitations</strong>: The Fortune 500 list focuses on revenue, so many true hidden champions (especially smaller firms or startups) may not appear if their revenues are below the threshold (~$7 billion minimum for 2025). <a href="https://us500.com/fortune-500-companies"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Public vs. Private</strong>: Many hidden champions are privately held, making financial data scarce. For example, family-owned firms like Koch Industries (Fortune 500 but private) are low-profile but not obscure due to their scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Startup Landscape</strong>: Startups like Verkada or Axonius may not yet hit Fortune 500 revenue levels but are hidden champions in their sectors due to rapid growth and market dominance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sources-and-further-exploration">Sources and Further Exploration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Fortune 500 list (us500.com, demandsage.com) provides revenue-based rankings but doesn’t highlight low-profile status directly. Cross-referencing with industry reports or Crunchbase data helps identify niche leaders.<a href="https://us500.com/fortune-500-companies"></a><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/fortune-500-companies/"></a><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/500-startups-portfolio-companies"></a></li>
  <li>Forbes’ 2025 America’s Best Startup Employers list is a valuable resource for identifying innovative, low-profile startups with strong cultures and growth.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/americas-best-startup-employers/"></a></li>
  <li>Hermann Simon’s book <em>Hidden Champions of the 21st Century</em> offers a framework for identifying such firms, emphasizing their global niche dominance and discretion.</li>
