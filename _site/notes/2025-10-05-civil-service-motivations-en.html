  <h3 id="refined-question">Refined Question</h3>
<p>Your query touches on the motivations behind pursuing civil service jobs in China (especially for the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP), the perceived meaninglessness and political pressures involved, and the potential long-term personal and ethical consequences—like resentment, moral decay, selfishness, and even harmful behaviors—when people enter these roles for security, ease, or power rather than true public service. I’ve refined it to: <strong>In China’s civil service system, do many people join government jobs primarily for stability, perks, or influence rather than genuine service to the public, and does this mismatch lead to widespread corruption, psychological strain, and a cycle of resentment or unethical behavior among officials?</strong></p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>
<p>Yes, there’s substantial evidence that a significant portion of people in China pursue civil service roles—often through the highly competitive national exam system—more for personal security and stability than for altruistic public service, and this can indeed foster a culture of resentment, corruption, and moral erosion over time. However, it’s not universal; some enter with prosocial intentions, though the system’s structure often erodes those ideals. I’ll break it down step by step, drawing on studies, reports, and analyses of the bureaucracy.</p>

<h4 id="1-motivations-for-joining-security-over-service">1. <strong>Motivations for Joining: Security Over Service</strong></h4>
<p>China’s civil service exam (known as the guokao) is one of the world’s toughest, with millions competing for a tiny fraction of spots each year—pass rates hover around 1-2%. While the system is framed as a meritocratic path to serve the nation, real-world drivers are often pragmatic and self-interested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Job Security in an Uncertain Economy</strong>: In a volatile job market plagued by youth unemployment (peaking at over 20% in recent years) and economic slowdowns, government jobs offer ironclad stability. They come with lifelong employment, pensions, housing subsidies, and protections against layoffs—rarities in the private sector. A 2021 Economist analysis noted that amid COVID disruptions and tech crackdowns, applications surged 50% year-over-year, with many viewing it as a “safe haven” rather than a calling. Similarly, a 2024 study on Chinese youth enthusiasm for the exam highlighted “employment anxiety” as the top factor, not ideological commitment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ease and Perks</strong>: These roles are often seen as low-pressure compared to high-stakes private work, with predictable hours and social prestige (the “iron rice bowl” legacy from Mao-era socialism). A ThinkChina report described a societal “obsession” with civil service, where families push kids into it for the status and benefits, leading to tragic burnout cases—like suicides from exam stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Power and Influence</strong>: For some, it’s about access to networks and decision-making clout, especially in a one-party system where CCP loyalty opens doors to promotions. Research on motivations for public service careers in China (2020) found that while “prosocial” reasons (e.g., helping society) exist, extrinsic factors like job security and advancement dominate, particularly among urban graduates.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the system’s design—endless political study sessions on Xi Jinping Thought, rote memorization of party doctrine—feels “boring” and “nonsensical” to many, as you described. It’s less about serving people (like innovative business leaders) and more about checking boxes for survival. This attracts those prioritizing ease or power, sidelining true reformers.</p>

<h4 id="2-the-path-to-corruption-and-betrayal-of-the-soul">2. <strong>The Path to Corruption and “Betrayal of the Soul”</strong></h4>
<p>When motivations skew toward self-preservation, the bureaucracy’s rigid hierarchy and opacity can amplify ethical drift. Corruption isn’t just anecdotal; it’s systemic, costing an estimated 3% of GDP annually through bribes, kickbacks, and fund misuse.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prevalence and Incentives</strong>: Wikipedia’s overview of corruption in China details how cadre-level graft thrives due to weak oversight and promotion pressures—officials must hit growth targets, often via shady deals. A 2023 study on “residual corruption” in the civil service argued that even post-anti-corruption drives, low-level perks (like dining bans under Xi’s 2025 austerity rules) persist because the system rewards loyalty to superiors over public good. High-rankers, as you noted, exemplify this: reports on CCP leadership wealth (2025 DNI assessment) link elite corruption to lavish lifestyles, mistresses, and offshore assets, far from “serving the people.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Moral Erosion</strong>: Your point about “making leaders happy instead of users” rings true. In a top-down CCP structure, sycophancy trumps innovation—managers curry favor upward, betraying broader duties. This “soul betrayal” breeds resentment: officials feel trapped in meaningless tasks (e.g., endless propaganda drills), leading to cynicism. A 2019 anthropological study on “Officials’ Heartache” described rising suicides among bureaucrats, pathologized as depression but rooted in the soul-crushing gap between ideals and reality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-long-term-psychological-and-ethical-toll-from-resentment-to-evil">3. <strong>Long-Term Psychological and Ethical Toll: From Resentment to “Evil”</strong></h4>
<p>The grind doesn’t just bore; it warps. Studies show bureaucracy in authoritarian settings like China’s fosters distrust, selfishness, and harm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Health Strain</strong>: Government employees report high chronic fatigue (43% in a 2022 survey), lower well-being, and burnout from stressors like anti-corruption fears—Xi’s campaign improved detection but spiked anxiety, especially for low-rankers (2024 Journal of Comparative Economics). A Nature study (2023) linked job dissatisfaction to poorer quality of life, with psychological contracts (unmet expectations of fairness) mediating burnout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cycle of Selfishness and Harm</strong>: Resentment festers into paranoia and exploitation. “Officials’ Heartache” research (2018, updated 2025) ties this to “therapeutic governance,” where the state frames distress as personal weakness, ignoring systemic rot. Over time, this can manifest as you described: lying for promotions, harming rivals, or even extreme corruption (e.g., organ harvesting scandals tied to elite longevity quests, though unproven at scale). High-rankers, insulated by power, become “evil” archetypes—selfish, untrusting, and vengeful—mirroring your “want to kill people” hyperbole, substantiated by cases of purged officials’ families ruined in purges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not Inevitable, But Common</strong>: Positive outliers exist—those with strong “psychological capital” (resilience, optimism) perform better without descending into toxicity (2024 PMC study). But the system’s incentives tilt toward the dark side: power hunger unchecked leads to betrayal, as business parallels show (e.g., managers prioritizing bosses over customers).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, yes—many succeed in this system by compromising ideals, perpetuating a cycle where security trumps service. It breeds resentment that poisons the heart, turning capable people into cogs who harm others for scraps of power or money. True change would require decentralizing authority and rewarding genuine impact, but in CCP China, that’s unlikely. If you’re in or eyeing this world, prioritizing personal ethics over the grind might be the real “success.”</p>
