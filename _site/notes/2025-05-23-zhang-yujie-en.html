  <p>There appears to be some confusion in the available information regarding Zhang Yujie and their role with ATL (Amperex Technology Limited) and CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited). Based on the provided sources, Zhang Yujie is referenced as the honorary chairman of CATL, who passed away in February 2022, and was a significant figure in the early development of CATL. However, there is conflicting information, as some sources primarily highlight Robin Zeng Yuqun as the founder, chairman, and CEO of CATL, with no clear indication that Zhang Yujie held the position of chairman in an executive capacity. Below, I aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to Zhang Yujie, focusing on their role with ATL and CATL, while addressing the limited and ambiguous information available.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="comprehensive-introduction-to-zhang-yujie">Comprehensive Introduction to Zhang Yujie</h3>

<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Zhang Yujie (died February 14, 2022, at age 79) was a pivotal figure in the history of CATL, recognized as the honorary chairman of the company. While the specific details of Zhang Yujie’s life, education, and career trajectory are not extensively documented in the provided sources, their contributions to CATL’s establishment and growth in the lithium-ion battery industry are notable. Zhang Yujie’s role appears to be closely tied to the early strategic partnerships and foundational efforts that helped transform CATL into a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage battery manufacturing.</p>

<p><strong>Role in ATL and CATL</strong><br />
Zhang Yujie is primarily associated with CATL through a partnership formed in 2009 with Chen (likely Chen Tanghua, a pioneering researcher in China’s lithium battery technology, though not explicitly named in all sources). This collaboration was instrumental in advancing China’s battery sector. In 2011, CATL was established as a spin-off from ATL, a company founded in 1999 by Robin Zeng Yuqun, which initially focused on lithium-ion batteries for consumer electronics. Zhang Yujie’s involvement in this period is described as critical, as they worked alongside Chen to position CATL as a fully Chinese-funded company that became a major player in the global battery market. By 2014, CATL and other Chinese firms had achieved dominance in global lithium-ion battery production, largely due to these early efforts.<a href="https://english.news.cn/20250214/aeaab2bc6c7f4b7995af5c6f2403501e/c.html"></a><a href="https://slguardian.org/trailblazing-leader-in-chinas-energy-revolution/"></a></p>

<p>As honorary chairman, Zhang Yujie’s role likely involved strategic oversight or advisory contributions rather than day-to-day executive leadership, as Robin Zeng is consistently identified as the founder, chairman, and CEO of CATL. A notable anecdote highlights Zhang Yujie’s influence on Zeng, as a calligraphy plaque with the phrase “赌性坚强” (roughly translated as “keep gambling” or “strong gambling spirit”) was originally in Zhang’s office. Zeng admired and adopted this plaque, reflecting a shared entrepreneurial mindset that shaped CATL’s bold approach to innovation and market leadership.<a href="https://interconnected.blog/robin-zeng-catls-prodigious-gambler/"></a></p>

<p><strong>Contributions to the Battery Industry</strong><br />
Zhang Yujie’s partnership with Chen in 2009 catalyzed advancements in lithium battery technology, particularly through close collaboration with scientists. This partnership helped CATL transition from ATL’s consumer electronics focus to EV and energy storage batteries, aligning with China’s growing emphasis on new energy vehicles (NEVs). By 2014, CATL’s innovations contributed to China’s dominance in global lithium-ion battery production. Zhang’s influence extended to strategic shifts toward next-generation technologies, such as solid-state lithium batteries, which Chen noted as critical for improving energy density and safety beyond the limitations of liquid lithium-ion batteries (300 watt-hours/kg).<a href="https://english.news.cn/20250214/aeaab2bc6c7f4b7995af5c6f2403501e/c.html"></a><a href="https://slguardian.org/trailblazing-leader-in-chinas-energy-revolution/"></a></p>

<p><strong>Legacy and Recognition</strong><br />
Zhang Yujie’s contributions were recognized through their designation as honorary chairman of CATL, a title reflecting their foundational role in the company’s success. Their passing on February 14, 2022, was announced on CATL’s official website, underscoring their significance to the organization. The lack of detailed biographical information, such as birth date, education, or early career, suggests that Zhang Yujie may have played a more behind-the-scenes role compared to high-profile figures like Robin Zeng. Nonetheless, their partnership with Chen and influence on CATL’s early development were instrumental in establishing the company as the world’s largest EV battery manufacturer, with a 37.9% global market share in 2024.<a href="https://equalocean.com/briefing/20220215230119888"></a><a href="https://cnevpost.com/2025/04/24/catl-founder-xpeng-chairman-become-et9-owners/"></a></p>

<p><strong>Clarification on Role and Identity</strong><br />
There is some ambiguity in the sources regarding Zhang Yujie’s exact role. While described as “ATL (later CATL) chairman” in some contexts, the primary sources consistently identify Robin Zeng as the chairman and CEO of CATL since its founding. The reference to Zhang Yujie as “chairman” in 2009 (pre-CATL) may indicate a leadership role within ATL before its acquisition by TDK in 2005 or a misattribution in certain reports. The honorary chairman title suggests a ceremonial or advisory role rather than an executive one. Additionally, a separate individual named Zhang Yujie, a young Chinese footballer born in 2002, is unrelated to this context, indicating potential confusion due to the commonality of the name.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yujie"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cultural and Symbolic Influence</strong><br />
Zhang Yujie’s legacy is also tied to the entrepreneurial spirit they inspired in CATL’s leadership. The “gambling spirit” plaque in their office, later adopted by Zeng, symbolizes a willingness to take risks, which was crucial in CATL’s rapid rise amidst intense competition and evolving government policies. This mindset helped CATL navigate challenges, such as the reduction of government subsidies, and pursue ambitious innovations like the M3P and Shenxing LFP batteries.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATL"></a><a href="https://interconnected.blog/robin-zeng-catls-prodigious-gambler/"></a></p>

<p><strong>Limitations in Available Information</strong><br />
The sources provide limited personal details about Zhang Yujie, such as their birth year (approximately 1943, based on their age of 79 at death in 2022), education, or specific career milestones prior to 2009. Unlike Robin Zeng, whose academic credentials (marine engineering degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, MSc from South China University of Technology, and PhD from the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and career path are well-documented, Zhang Yujie’s background remains less clear. It is possible that Zhang held a senior role in ATL or a related scientific or industrial capacity before partnering with Chen and Zeng, but this is not explicitly confirmed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Zeng"></a><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Robin_Zeng"></a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Zhang Yujie was a key figure in the establishment of CATL, serving as its honorary chairman and contributing to its transformation from a consumer electronics battery manufacturer (ATL) to a global leader in EV and energy storage batteries. Their partnership with Chen in 2009 and collaboration with Robin Zeng were instrumental in CATL’s rise to dominance by 2014. While detailed biographical information is scarce, Zhang Yujie’s legacy is evident in CATL’s strategic advancements and the entrepreneurial ethos they inspired. Their passing in 2022 marked the loss of a significant, though less publicly documented, contributor to China’s new energy revolution.<a href="https://english.news.cn/20250214/aeaab2bc6c7f4b7995af5c6f2403501e/c.html"></a><a href="https://slguardian.org/trailblazing-leader-in-chinas-energy-revolution/"></a><a href="https://equalocean.com/briefing/20220215230119888"></a></p>
