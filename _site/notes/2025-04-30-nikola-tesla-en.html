  <p><strong>1. Early Life and Background</strong></p>

<p>Nikola Tesla was born on <strong>July 10, 1856</strong>, in the village of Smiljan, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). Of Serbian descent, Tesla was raised in a family deeply rooted in Orthodox Christian tradition. His father, Rev. Milutin Tesla, was an Orthodox priest, and his mother, Đuka Mandić, though unschooled, possessed a remarkable talent for crafting household tools and memorizing Serbian epic poetry—skills that likely influenced Tesla’s own ingenuity and eidetic memory.</p>

<p>From an early age, Tesla exhibited signs of exceptional intelligence and curiosity. He attended school in Karlovac and later studied electrical engineering at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz, Austria. He also spent a year at the University of Prague but never completed a formal degree. Despite this, Tesla’s self-taught knowledge and insatiable curiosity laid the foundation for his future as one of history’s most visionary inventors.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>2. Career Beginnings and Move to America</strong></p>

<p>In 1882, while working in Budapest, Tesla conceptualized the idea of the <strong>induction motor</strong>, a breakthrough that would later revolutionize electrical engineering. In 1884, he emigrated to the United States with little more than a few cents and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, then the world’s most famous inventor.</p>

<p>Tesla briefly worked for Edison in New York City, where he was tasked with improving the efficiency of Edison’s direct current (DC) generators. According to legend, when Tesla asked about a promised fee for successfully completing these tasks, Edison reportedly replied, “You don’t understand our American humor.” Disillusioned, Tesla left and struck out on his own.</p>

<p>This marked the beginning of the so-called “<strong>War of Currents</strong>“—a battle between Edison’s favored DC system and Tesla’s advocacy for alternating current (AC), which George Westinghouse supported.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>3. Contributions to Electricity and Power Systems</strong></p>

<p>Tesla’s greatest achievement was the development of the <strong>polyphase AC induction motor and transformer</strong>, which made long-distance transmission of electricity efficient and practical. This innovation became the backbone of modern electrical power systems.</p>

<p>Key milestones include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Patents:</strong> Tesla held over 300 patents worldwide during his lifetime.</li>
  <li><strong>Westinghouse Partnership:</strong> His collaboration with George Westinghouse led to the successful electrification of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair (World’s Columbian Exposition), demonstrating the superiority of AC over DC.</li>
  <li><strong>Niagara Falls Project (1895):</strong> The first major hydroelectric power plant using Tesla’s AC system was built at Niagara Falls, marking a turning point in the adoption of AC as the global standard for electrical distribution.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>4. Wireless Communication and Other Innovations</strong></p>

<p>Beyond electric power, Tesla was a pioneer in many other fields, often decades ahead of his time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Radio and Radar:</strong> Tesla conducted early experiments in radio communication and filed a basic patent for a radio-controlled device—an early form of remote control—in 1898.</li>
  <li><strong>Wireless Transmission of Energy:</strong> Perhaps his most ambitious project was <strong>Wardenclyffe Tower</strong> on Long Island, intended to transmit wireless messages and even energy across the Atlantic. Although the project was never completed due to lack of funding, it laid the groundwork for modern wireless technology.</li>
  <li><strong>Tesla Coil:</strong> An electrical resonant transformer circuit invented by Tesla in 1891, used today in radios, wireless technologies, and high-voltage experiments.</li>
  <li><strong>X-rays, Lasers, and Fluorescent Lighting:</strong> Tesla contributed to early explorations in these areas, and his work predated several official discoveries and inventions by others.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>5. Later Years and Legacy</strong></p>

<p>Despite his genius and contributions, Tesla died in relative obscurity and poverty. He spent much of his later life pursuing increasingly grandiose and unproven ideas, often unsupported by the scientific community or investors.</p>

<p>Tesla passed away on <strong>January 7, 1943</strong>, in New York City. At the time of his death, his name had largely faded from public consciousness, overshadowed by contemporaries like Edison and Marconi.</p>

<p>However, the second half of the 20th century saw a resurgence of interest in Tesla:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultural Icon:</strong> Today, Tesla is celebrated not only as an inventor but as a symbol of brilliance, eccentricity, and the underdog in science.</li>
  <li><strong>Units and Recognition:</strong> The SI unit of magnetic flux density, the <strong>tesla (T)</strong>, was named in his honor in 1960.</li>
  <li><strong>Pop Culture:</strong> His likeness appears in movies, books, video games, and music, cementing his status as a cult figure and inspiration for scientists and engineers around the world.</li>
  <li><strong>Technological Influence:</strong> Modern technologies such as <strong>wireless charging</strong>, <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, and even electric vehicles (e.g., Tesla Inc.) owe a conceptual debt to his pioneering work.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>6. Quotes and Philosophy</strong></p>

<p>Tesla was known not only for his inventions but also for his eloquence and philosophical outlook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you wish to understand the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My brain is only a receiver. In the Universe, there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength, and inspiration.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Nikola Tesla was a visionary scientist, engineer, and futurist whose groundbreaking contributions to electricity, magnetism, and wireless communication have profoundly shaped the modern world. Though underappreciated in his lifetime, Tesla’s legacy endures both in technology and in culture as a symbol of unyielding curiosity and the relentless pursuit of progress.</p>
