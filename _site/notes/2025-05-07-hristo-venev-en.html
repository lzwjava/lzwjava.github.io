<h3 id="competitive-programming-achievements">Competitive Programming Achievements</h3>
<p>Hristo Venev’s competitive programming career is marked by an extraordinary record at the IOI, where he competed as a contestant representing Bulgaria. He secured <strong>four gold medals and one silver medal</strong>, an achievement that ranks him <strong>second in the IOI’s all-time Hall of Fame</strong>. This places him among the elite in a competition known for identifying the world’s top young programming talent. His consistent performance at the IOI demonstrates his mastery of algorithmic problem-solving and coding under pressure.<a href="https://codeit.bg/season2/eng/news/view/201"></a><a href="https://codeit.bg/bul/news/view/201"></a></p>

<p>Beyond the IOI, Venev has participated in other prestigious programming contests. Under the handle <strong>mustrum_r</strong> on Topcoder, he has competed in high-level algorithmic challenges. During his time at Oxford University, he was part of a team that qualified for the <strong>ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals in 2017</strong>, showcasing his ability to collaborate and excel in team-based competitions. His competitive programming prowess is further evidenced by his participation in events like <strong>CodeIT</strong>, a prominent Bulgarian programming contest, where he was celebrated as a “world-renowned golden talent”.<a href="https://cphof.org/profile/ioi:2707"></a><a href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:mustrum_r"></a><a href="https://codeit.bg/season2/eng/news/view/201"></a></p>

<h3 id="academic-background">Academic Background</h3>
<p>Venev’s academic journey is as impressive as his competitive record. From <strong>2016 to 2020</strong>, he studied <strong>Computer Science at Oxford University</strong>, earning both a <strong>Bachelor’s degree</strong> and a <strong>Master’s degree</strong>. His time at Oxford not only honed his technical skills but also exposed him to advanced topics in computer science, setting the stage for his later research career. Since <strong>October 2022</strong>, Venev has been pursuing a <strong>PhD at the Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT)</strong> at Sofia University, Bulgaria, under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Martin Vechev</strong>. His research interests include <strong>programming languages</strong>, <strong>formal verification</strong>, and <strong>quantum computing</strong>.<a href="https://codeit.bg/season2/eng/news/view/201"></a><a href="https://codeit.bg/bul/news/view/201"></a><a href="https://insait.ai/hristo-venev/"></a></p>

<h3 id="research-and-contributions">Research and Contributions</h3>
<p>As a doctoral student at INSAIT, Venev has made significant strides in quantum computing research. His work-in-progress on developing the <strong>first high-level quantum compiler</strong> earned him <strong>third place at the ACM POPL Student Research Competition</strong> in Boston in 2023. This project aims to make quantum programming more accessible, reflecting his ability to tackle cutting-edge challenges in computer science. Additionally, Venev co-authored a paper titled <strong>“Modular Synthesis of Efficient Quantum Uncomputation”</strong>, published on arXiv in June 2024. This work introduces a modular approach to synthesizing uncomputation for expressive quantum programs, demonstrating his expertise in both theoretical and applied aspects of quantum computing.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/insaitinstitute_research-quantumcomputing-programminglanguages-activity-7022188681314590720-iDUl"></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14227"></a></p>
