    <ul>
      <li>In 2021, Gao published a seminal paper in <em>Inventiones Mathematicae</em>, one of the top mathematics journals, titled “The J-equation and the supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation.” This work solved two critical equations proposed by prominent mathematicians, including Xiuxiong Chen, Simon Donaldson, and Shing-Tung Yau, under the premise of stability.<a href="http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html"></a><a href="https://www.yqqlm.com/2021/02/a-26-year-old-mathematician-from-the-university-of-science-and-technology-of-china-overcomes-world-problems-in-the-field-of-complex-differential-geometry/"></a></li>
      <li>Gao established a bridge between the Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation (central to quantum mechanics) and the Kähler-Einstein equation (linked to general relativity). Reviewers praised his introduction of two bold ideas, noting that such results are “extremely rare.”<a href="https://www.yqqlm.com/2021/02/a-26-year-old-mathematician-from-the-university-of-science-and-technology-of-china-overcomes-world-problems-in-the-field-of-complex-differential-geometry/"></a></li>
      <li>This breakthrough advanced complex differential geometry by providing new insights into the interplay between geometric and physical theories.<a href="http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gravitational Instantons with Quadratic Volume Growth</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>In collaboration with Xiuxiong Chen, Gao proved in 2015 (at age 21) that there are only four types of gravitational instantons with quadratic volume growth.<a href="https://www.wzu.edu.cn/info/1505/41084.htm"></a></li>
      <li>This result, published in a series of papers in <em>Acta Mathematica</em>, <em>Mathematische Annalen</em>, and <em>Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik</em> (Crelle’s Journal), classified gravitational instantons with faster-than-quadratic curvature decay.<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/"></a><a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/~gchen/"></a></li>
      <li>These findings have implications for understanding geometric structures in higher-dimensional spaces and their applications in theoretical physics, particularly in general relativity and string theory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>G2 Manifolds and Singularities</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Gao’s work on G2 manifolds, which are seven-dimensional geometric structures relevant to string theory, includes studies of nodal singularities along circles and asymptotic convergence near isolated singularities.<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/"></a><a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/~gchen/"></a></li>
      <li>His papers, such as “G2 manifolds with nodal singularities along circles” (<em>The Journal of Geometric Analysis</em>, 2021) and “Shi-type estimates and finite time singularities of flows of G2 structures” (<em>The Quarterly Journal of Mathematics</em>, 2018), have advanced the understanding of singularities in exceptional holonomy manifolds.<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative Works with Jeff Viaclovsky and Ruobing Zhang</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Gao co-authored several papers with Jeff Viaclovsky and Ruobing Zhang, including:
        <ul>
          <li>“Torelli-type theorems for gravitational instantons with quadratic volume growth” (<em>Duke Mathematical Journal</em>, 2024), which developed topological and analytical tools for gravitational instantons.<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/"></a></li>
          <li>“Hodge theory on ALG* manifolds” (<em>Crelle’s Journal</em>, 2023) and “Collapsing Ricci-flat metrics on elliptic K3 surfaces” (<em>Communications in Analysis and Geometry</em>, 2020), which explored geometric collapsing and asymptotic behaviors.<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/"></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>These works have deepened the understanding of hyperkähler and Ricci-flat geometries, with applications in algebraic geometry and theoretical physics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asymptotic Geometry of Moduli Spaces</strong>:
    <ul>
