  <p>Jakub Pachocki is a distinguished computer scientist, artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, and former competitive programmer, widely recognized as the Chief Scientist at OpenAI, a leading AI research organization. Born in 1991 in Gdańsk, Poland, Pachocki has emerged as a pivotal figure in advancing AI technologies, notably for his role in overseeing the development of GPT-4 and other groundbreaking models. Praised by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as “easily one of the greatest minds of our generation,” Pachocki combines a robust academic background, competitive programming accolades, and extensive research leadership to drive innovation in deep learning and AI.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://x.com/czardam/status/1840453269853712607"></a></p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h3>
<p>Pachocki grew up in Gdynia, Poland, where he attended III LO (High School No. 3), graduating in 2010. His aptitude for problem-solving and computer science was evident early on, mentored by Ryszard Szubartowski, a teacher known for nurturing talented programmers. During high school, Pachocki was a six-time finalist in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), securing a silver medal in 2009 and a gold medal (first place) at the Baltic Olympiad in Informatics (BOI) in 2009. These achievements marked him as a prodigy in competitive programming.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://www.wirtualnemedia.pl/artykul/jakub-pachocki-chief-scientist-w-openai"></a></p>

<p>He pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Warsaw, completing it in 2013. At Warsaw, he represented his university at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), where his team won a gold medal and placed second overall in the 2012 World Finals. In the same year, Pachocki claimed the championship title at Google Code Jam, having previously secured third place in 2011. These accomplishments underscored his exceptional logical and mathematical skills, critical for his later AI research.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/meet-jakub-pachocki-openais-new-chief-scientist-after-ilya-sutskevers-exit-sam-altman-hails-him-as-one-of-the-greatest-minds-of-our-generation-2024-05-15"></a></p>

<p>Pachocki continued his academic journey at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), earning a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2016 under the supervision of Gary L. Miller. His doctoral dissertation, <em>Graphs and Beyond: Faster Algorithms for High Dimensional Convex Optimization</em>, focused on designing efficient algorithms for machine learning and optimization, areas foundational to modern AI. Following his Ph.D., he conducted postdoctoral research at Harvard University in 2016–2017, working in Jelani Nelson’s group, and was a visiting scientist at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in 2019, further honing his expertise in theoretical computer science and deep learning.<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/meret/home"></a><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/jakub-pachocki"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a></p>

<h3 id="career-and-contributions">Career and Contributions</h3>
<h4 id="early-professional-experience">Early Professional Experience</h4>
<p>Before joining OpenAI, Pachocki gained industry experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook in 2011 and 2012, where he worked on software development projects. These internships provided practical exposure to large-scale systems, complementing his theoretical expertise.<a href="https://theorg.com/org/openai/org-chart/jakub-pachocki"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a></p>

<h4 id="openai-tenure">OpenAI Tenure</h4>
<p>Pachocki joined OpenAI in 2017, embarking on a trajectory that would see him rise to one of the organization’s most influential roles. His early work at OpenAI included serving as Research Lead for the Dota team, which developed OpenAI Five, an AI system capable of competing at a professional level in the complex strategy game Dota 2. This project demonstrated AI’s potential to handle intricate, multi-agent environments. In 2019, he became Research Lead for the Reasoning Team, and by 2021, he was leading the Science of Deep Learning initiative, focusing on advancing the theoretical foundations of AI models.<a href="https://theorg.com/org/openai/org-chart/jakub-pachocki"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a></p>

<p>In November 2021, Pachocki was appointed Principal of Research, and by 2023, he served as Director of Research, overseeing OpenAI’s most ambitious projects. His leadership was instrumental in the development of GPT-4, a multimodal AI model renowned for its advanced language and reasoning capabilities, and GPT-4o, which integrates text, audio, and vision inputs. He also spearheaded projects like Q* (later renamed Strawberry), aimed at enhancing AI’s reasoning abilities. In May 2024, following the departure of his mentor and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, Pachocki was promoted to Chief Scientist, solidifying his role as a guiding force in OpenAI’s mission to advance safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI).<a href="https://theorg.com/org/openai/org-chart/jakub-pachocki"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Pachocki"></a></p>

<p>Pachocki’s research contributions extend to numerous publications, with 31 works cited over 843 times, covering topics like dense subgraph discovery in graphs with negative weights and reinforcement learning in multi-agent environments.
