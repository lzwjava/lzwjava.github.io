  <p>The impact of AI and tools like ChatGPT on competitive programming contests such as the International Collegiate Programmingburgo Programming Contest (ICPC) 2024 and the International Olymp   iad in Informatics (IOI) 2025 is a topic of growing interest, as these tools can potentially influence preparation, participation, and the integrity of such events. Below, I explore the potential impacts based on available information and reasonable inference, addressing both ICPC 2024 and IOI 2025.</p>

<h3 id="icpc-acm-icpc-2024">ICPC ACM ICPC 2024</h3>
<p>The ICPC is a team-based algorithmic programming contest for college students, involving complex problem-solving under strict time constraints with limited computer access. The 48th ICPC World Finals took place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from September 15–20, 2024.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest"></a></p>

<h4 id="potential-impact-of-aichatgpt-on-icpc-2024">Potential Impact of AI/ChatGPT on ICPC 2024</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Preparation and Training</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Positive Impact</strong>: AI tools like ChatGPT can assist participants in preparing for ICPC by generating practice problems, explaining algorithms, or debugging code. These tools can help students learn complex concepts like graph theory, dynamic programming, or data structures, which are critical for ICPC problems.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-acm-icpc/"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: However, the fast-paced, team-based nature of ICPC, where teams solve 8–12 problems in five hours using a single computer, limits the direct use of AI during the contest itself, as external tools or internet access are typically prohibited to ensure fairness.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contest Integrity</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cheating Concerns</strong>: The use of AI tools during the contest is highly restricted, as ICPC enforces strict rules against external assistance. Programs are submitted and evaluated instantly, with penalties for errors, making real-time AI use impractical.<a href="https://ioi.te.lv/contest/international.shtml"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Detection Challenges</strong>: While AI could theoretically generate solutions, the unique and complex nature of ICPC problems often requires creative and optimized approaches that general-purpose AI models may not handle efficiently under time pressure. Contest organizers likely employ proctoring and monitoring to prevent unauthorized tool usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Problem Design</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI in Problem Creation</strong>: Contest organizers might use AI to design or test problems, ensuring they are challenging yet solvable. However, there’s no direct evidence from the provided sources that AI was used in problem creation for ICPC 2024. The complexity and mathematical nature of ICPC problems (e.g., combinatorics, graph theory) suggest human expertise remains central to problem design.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Post-Contest Analysis</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>AI tools could be used post-contest to analyze solutions or optimize code, but this would primarily benefit learning and future preparation rather than the contest itself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="evidence-from-sources">Evidence from Sources</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There is no direct mention in the provided sources of AI or ChatGPT impacting ICPC 2024 specifically. However, the general structure of ICPC, with its emphasis on real-time problem-solving and restricted resources, suggests minimal direct impact during the contest.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest"></a><a href="https://ioi.te.lv/contest/international.shtml"></a></li>
  <li>The sources highlight the contest’s focus on teamwork, creativity, and performance under pressure, which are human-centric skills less likely to be augmented by AI in a live setting.<a href="https://icpc.global/"></a><a href="https://icpc.global/worldfinals/results"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ioi-2025">IOI 2025</h3>
<p>The IOI is an individual competitive programming contest for secondary school students, scheduled to take place in La Paz, Bolivia, from July 27 to August 3, 2025. It involves solving six algorithmic problems over two days, with each day consisting of three problems to be solved in five hours using C++.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a><a href="https://allen.in/olympiad/international-olympiad-in-informatics"></a></p>

<h4 id="potential-impact-of-aichatgpt-on-ioi-2025">Potential Impact of AI/ChatGPT on IOI 2025</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Preparation and Training</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Positive Impact</strong>: Similar to ICPC, AI tools like ChatGPT can aid IOI participants in training by providing explanations, generating practice problems, or suggesting optimizations for algorithms. The IOI syllabus includes topics like data structures, algorithms, and discrete mathematics, which AI can help clarify.<a href="https://allen.in/olympiad/international-olympiad-in-informatics"></a><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-acm-icpc/"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Example</strong>: A contestant could use ChatGPT to understand a complex algorithm like Dijkstra’s or to debug a C++ program, enhancing their preparation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contest Integrity</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strict Regulations</strong>: IOI contestants work individually without external help, including web access or communication with others. The use of AI tools like ChatGPT during the contest is prohibited, and the contest environment is tightly controlled to prevent cheating.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Interactive Problems</strong>: Since IOI 2010, some tasks involve interactive problems where programs interact with a secret library, requiring real-time adaptability. Current AI models may struggle to provide optimized solutions for such dynamic, contest-specific problems under time constraints.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>AI in Contest Performance</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A post on X mentions OpenAI’s o1-ioi model competing at IOI 2024, achieving a 49th percentile ranking with hand-crafted test-time strategies. This suggests that advanced AI models are being tested in competitive programming environments, but their performance is not yet dominant.</li>
      <li>For IOI 2025, while AI could theoretically assist in problem-solving, the contest’s structure (individual work, no external tools, time pressure) limits its direct impact. The o1-ioi example indicates AI’s potential but also its current limitations in achieving top-tier results against human competitors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Problem Design and Evaluation</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Organizers might use AI to generate or validate problem sets, ensuring fairness and difficulty. The IOI syllabus and task evaluation process are rigorous, and AI could assist in creating subtasks with graduated difficulty or testing solutions against secret test data.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a><a href="https://allen.in/olympiad/international-olympiad-in-informatics"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="evidence-from-sources-1">Evidence from Sources</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The X post about OpenAI’s o1-ioi model at IOI 2024 provides the most direct evidence of AI’s involvement in a similar context, suggesting that AI models are being explored in competitive programming but are not yet outperforming top human competitors.</li>
  <li>The IOI’s strict rules against external assistance and the individual nature of the contest minimize the risk of AI use during the event.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a></li>
  <li>The sources emphasize the IOI’s focus on algorithmic problem-solving and computational thinking, areas where human intuition and speed remain critical.<a href="https://ioinformatics.org/"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broader-considerations">Broader Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Criticism of Competitive Programming</strong>: Some professional developers argue that competitive programming contests like ICPC and IOI prioritize speed and short solutions over software engineering practices (e.g., code readability, modularity). AI-generated code might exacerbate this by producing quick but poorly structured solutions, though this is less relevant during contests due to restricted tool access.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming"></a></li>
  <li><strong>AI’s Role in Learning</strong>: Both ICPC and IOI participants benefit from AI tools in training, as platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, and AtCoder provide practice problems that AI can help analyze. However, the contests themselves are designed to test raw problem-solving ability under controlled conditions.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-acm-icpc/"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Future Implications</strong>: The OpenAI o1-ioi experiment at IOI 2024 suggests that AI’s role in competitive programming is evolving. By IOI 2025, more advanced models could emerge, but contest rules will likely continue to restrict their use during live events.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>AI and tools like ChatGPT likely had minimal direct impact on the ICPC 2024 and are expected to have a similarly limited direct impact on IOI 2025 due to strict contest regulations prohibiting external tools and internet access. However, these tools significantly aid preparation by helping students learn algorithms, debug code, and practice problems. The OpenAI o1-ioi experiment at IOI 2024 indicates AI’s potential in competitive programming, but its 49th percentile performance suggests it is not yet a dominant force against top human competitors. Organizers may use AI for problem design or testing, but the core of both contests remains human-driven problem-solving under pressure. For the latest updates on IOI 2025, check the official IOI website (ioinformatics.org) or the hosting country’s website after the event.<a href="https://allen.in/olympiad/international-olympiad-in-informatics"></a></p>
