  <p>Your reflection on the housing market, using your family’s experience in Guangzhou as a lens, is compelling and resonates with broader trends. The 50% drop in your property’s value from 2 million CNY in 2022 to 1 million CNY by 2024 aligns with reports of China’s housing market struggles, where oversupply, developer debt crises, and shifting economic priorities have driven significant price corrections in cities like Guangzhou. This isn’t just a local phenomenon—global markets, from the U.S. to Europe, have faced similar pressures, with rising interest rates and changing demographics challenging the “property never loses value” mantra.</p>

<p>Your point about real estate’s disconnect from the knowledge-based, AI-driven economy is thought-provoking. Construction and property markets often lag behind technological disruption due to their reliance on slow-moving systems—land policies, zoning laws, and bureaucratic oversight. These systems clash with the agility of digital economies, where value increasingly lies in intangible assets like data, intellectual property, or innovation.</p>

<p>The shift in mindset you describe is also evident. Younger generations, especially, are prioritizing flexibility—renting over owning, or investing in experiences and skills over fixed assets. This could indeed signal a redefinition of wealth, where liquidity and adaptability trump traditional markers like homeownership.</p>

<p>Your narrative makes sense and captures a pivotal moment. The housing market’s “death” may be exaggerated, but it’s certainly transforming, forcing a reckoning with what value means in a digital age. If you’d like, I can dig into specific data on Guangzhou’s market or global trends to deepen the analysis—let me know!</p>

<hr />

<p>Yes, people across the world have been vocal about housing affordability and mortgage concerns in recent decades, driven by a mix of economic, social, and policy factors. Your experience with the sharp decline in your Guangzhou property’s value reflects a broader global sentiment about housing market challenges. Below, I’ll break down the trends and complaints based on available data and sentiment, including how they tie into the shifting paradigms you mentioned.</p>

<h3 id="global-complaints-about-house-prices-and-mortgages">Global Complaints About House Prices and Mortgages</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Rising House Prices Outpacing Income Growth</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Global Trend</strong>: Since the early 2000s, house prices in many countries have surged faster than wages, making homeownership increasingly unattainable, especially for first-time buyers. For example, in the U.S., the median home price in March 2025 was $361,000, while incomes have not kept pace, with mortgage payments consuming a record share of income for first-time buyers.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/housing-market-predictions/"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Sentiment</strong>: Posts on X highlight frustration, with users like @BikoKonstantin1 calling Australia’s housing market a “full-blown disaster” due to unaffordable prices, and @_Investinq noting that institutional investors buying homes in bulk exacerbate competition for families.<a href="https://x.com/TihoBrkan/status/1416661834023776256"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Your Context</strong>: The traditional belief that “property never loses value” has been challenged globally, not just in Guangzhou. For instance, the IMF reported in 2023 that two-thirds of OECD countries saw inflation-adjusted housing price declines, with countries like Denmark leading the drop. This mirrors your observation of a global correction.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/charted-where-house-prices-have-fallen-in-the-last-quarter/"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>High Mortgage Rates and Borrowing Costs</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Global Trend</strong>: Central banks’ efforts to combat inflation since 2022 have driven mortgage rates up significantly. In the U.S., 30-year fixed mortgage rates hit 7.08% in October 2022 and remained elevated at 6.81% by April 2025. In the UK, rates for two-year fixed mortgages were around 5.07% in May 2025, down slightly from earlier peaks but still high compared to pre-2022 levels.<a href="https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart"></a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates-forecast/"></a><a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/whats-happening-to-house-prices-aVCwI8I22pBe"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Complaints</strong>: High rates have increased monthly payments, squeezing affordability. For example, a $361,000 U.S. home at 6.65% in March 2025 results in a monthly payment of $1,853, compared to $1,844 for a $354,000 home at 6.79% in 2024—an extra $2,133 over a 30-year loan. In the UK, first-time buyers in the South of England spend over half their income on mortgage payments. X users like @AlvaApp emphasize how rising rates make “every dollar of debt heavier.”<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/housing-market-predictions/"></a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-63147101"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Your Context</strong>: The disconnect you noted between real estate’s traditional model and the digital economy is relevant here. High borrowing costs, driven by central bank policies, clash with the expectation of affordable housing, amplifying dissatisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Regional Variations in Complaints</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>China</strong>: Your Guangzhou experience reflects China’s broader property crisis, where developer debt and oversupply led to significant price drops in cities like Guangzhou by 2024. Sentiment on X and web reports suggest frustration with government interventions failing to stabilize markets.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-house-prices-set-extend-declines-risk-more-with-higher-rates-2023-03-10/"></a></li>
      <li><strong>U.S. and Canada</strong>: Affordability is a major grievance, with high prices and rates locking out first-time buyers. In Canada, variable-rate mortgages (common there) have made households particularly vulnerable to rate hikes, prompting complaints about rapid price declines and financial strain.<a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/global-housing-market-decline-will-slow-growth-worldwide/"></a><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/05/31/how-falling-home-prices-could-strain-financial-markets-as-interest-rates-rise"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Europe</strong>: In the UK, house prices rose 6.4% annually by March 2025, but high rates and stamp duty changes fueled buyer frustration. In Germany, prices dropped 14% from their 2022 peak, with 15% of households spending over 40% of income on housing.<a href="https://moneyweek.com/investments/house-prices/house-prices"></a><a href="https://www.knightsbridgewealth.co.uk/global-property-prices-falling/"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Australia and New Zealand</strong>: These markets saw steep post-pandemic price surges (up to 50%), followed by corrections, leading to complaints about unaffordability and variable-rate mortgage burdens.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-house-prices-set-extend-declines-risk-more-with-higher-rates-2023-03-10/"></a><a href="https://x.com/TihoBrkan/status/1416661834023776256"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Shifting Mindsets and Systemic Issues</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mindset Shift</strong>: Your point about people reassessing value in an AI-driven, knowledge-based economy is spot-on. Web sources note changing preferences, like demand for larger homes due to remote work, which keeps prices high despite rate hikes. On X, users express disillusionment with traditional homeownership as a wealth-building tool, with @BikoKonstantin1 questioning political promises to fix housing crises.<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/04/08/housing-is-one-reason-not-all-countries-feel-same-pinch-of-higher-interest-rates"></a><a href="https://www.knightsbridgewealth.co.uk/global-property-prices-falling/"></a><a href="https://x.com/TihoBrkan/status/1416661834023776256"></a></li>
      <li><strong>Systemic Issues</strong>: Complaints often target structural problems like low housing supply, zoning restrictions, and institutional investors outbidding families. You mentioned real estate’s entanglement with land policies and government controls—these are frequently criticized for stifling innovation and exacerbating shortages. For example, JLL analysts note a global slowdown in new housing construction, deepening shortages.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-house-prices-set-extend-declines-risk-more-with-higher-rates-2023-03-10/"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-the-complaints-are-widespread">Why the Complaints Are Widespread</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Economic Pressures</strong>: Post-pandemic inflation and rate hikes by central banks (e.g., U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB) have increased borrowing costs, with a 1% rate hike slowing house price growth by about 2%.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/charted-where-house-prices-have-fallen-in-the-last-quarter/"></a><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/03/14/house-prices-continue-to-fall-as-borrowing-costs-rise"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Pandemic Fallout</strong>: The 2020-2022 housing boom, driven by low rates (e.g., U.S. rates at 2.65% in 2021), created unsustainable price surges, followed by corrections that left buyers feeling trapped.<a href="https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Affordability Crisis</strong>: High prices, stagnant wages, and elevated rates have made homeownership a “luxury,” as noted on X. In many markets, affordability is at historic lows, with the U.S. and UK seeing median mortgage payments nearing record highs.<a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/investing-insights/interest-rates-impact-on-housing-market.html"></a><a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/whats-happening-to-house-prices-aVCwI8I22pBe"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Shift</strong>: Your observation about a digital-age rethinking of value aligns with global sentiment. People are questioning real estate’s role as a wealth store when digital assets, skills, or flexibility offer alternative paths. This is evident in declining demand for urban properties in some regions as remote work shifts priorities.<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/04/08/housing-is-one-reason-not-all-countries-feel-same-pinch-of-higher-interest-rates"></a></li>
