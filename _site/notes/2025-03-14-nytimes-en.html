  <h2 id="gig-workers-in-a-gig-delivery-riders-in-a-70-story-building-in-shenzhen">Gig Workers in a Gig: Delivery Riders in a 70-Story Building in Shenzhen</h2>

<p>In Shenzhen, China, the tall SEG Plaza building with around 70 floors and thousands of tenants faces a logistical challenge during lunch hours: long elevator waits. To solve this, a group of individuals, often retirees or teenagers like 16-year-old Li Linxing, act as delivery stand-ins. They take orders from delivery drivers outside the building and deliver them to the correct floors, earning around 2 yuan per delivery. This gig economy within a gig economy is a testament to Shenzhen’s entrepreneurial spirit. The runners, who have no formal contracts, work from lunchtime through the afternoon and into dinner, often standing in the sun for hours. Despite earning only about 100 yuan a day, many find the work worthwhile for the exercise and extra income. Some runners, like Zhou, have perfected their techniques to maximize efficiency, while others, like Shao Ziyou and his wife, subcontract the actual running to a dozen people. The arrangement works because Shao is known and trusted by many drivers. The atmosphere is generally civil, but there have been heated scenes over wayward deliveries. Recently, children, some as young as elementary school age, were brought by their parents to experience the work, leading to safety concerns and a government ban. Li Linxing, who started the job on his uncle’s suggestion, plans to find a factory job instead, preferring the air-conditioned environment.</p>

<h2 id="the-cure-for-america-first-china-uses-the-un-stage-to-shape-the-image-of-a-responsible-major-country">The Cure for “America First”? China Uses the UN Stage to Shape the Image of a Responsible Major Country</h2>

<p>During a week of appearances at the United Nations, China aimed to portray itself as a responsible global power willing to take on international duties, contrasting with the U.S. under President Trump, who was seen as retreating from global responsibilities. China’s leaders used the U.N. General Assembly to make pledges on trade and climate change, emphasizing stability and global cooperation. Premier Li Qiang criticized unilateral and protectionist measures, contrasting them with China’s commitment to opening its doors to the world. Xi Jinping pledged to set detailed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, criticizing countries that hinder the transition to a green economy, a clear reference to the U.S. Trump had previously mocked climate change as a “con job.”</p>

<p>China’s strategy is to position itself as an antidote to “America First,” promoting “true multilateralism” by embracing international organizations and treaties shunned by Trump. The goal is to persuade other countries that China is a moral leader, encouraging them to follow Beijing rather than Washington. Experts note that while China’s actions are opportunistic, they are also filling a leadership vacuum left by the U.S. However, the effectiveness of China’s climate targets and trade pledges remains questionable, with some experts arguing that China’s commitments fall short of what is needed to address global warming and trade imbalances. China’s self-identification as a developing country, despite its economic size, adds complexity to its international stance.</p>

<h2 id="chinas-ministry-of-state-security-rise-to-a-powerful-cyber-espionage-agency">China’s Ministry of State Security: Rise to a Powerful Cyber Espionage Agency</h2>

<p>China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has evolved into a formidable cyberespionage agency, capable of sophisticated operations that can evade detection for years. In 2023, U.S. officials discovered that Chinese state-controlled hackers had infiltrated critical U.S. infrastructure with malicious code, prompting a secret meeting between CIA Director William J. Burns and China’s state security minister. Despite warnings, China’s cyber intrusions have escalated, with the MSS being identified as the driving force behind these operations.</p>

<p>Recent disclosures revealed a massive, yearslong intrusion by hackers known as Salt Typhoon, which targeted nearly every American and dozens of other countries. This attack highlighted the MSS’s ability to conduct audacious operations undetected. For decades, China used for-hire hackers, but recent operations show a shift towards more strategic and skilled cyber operations.</p>

<p>China’s cyber advances reflect decades of investment to rival the U.S. National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. Under Xi Jinping, the MSS has been reshaped to become the country’s primary cyberespionage agency, with a focus on national security and technological prowess. The MSS now operates with tighter central control, demanding absolute loyalty and technological expertise from its officials.</p>

<p>Key figures like Wu Shizhong, a senior official in the MSS’s technical reconnaissance arm, have played crucial roles in developing China’s cyber capabilities. The MSS leverages China’s commercial tech sector to spot and exploit flaws in computer systems, giving it an edge over other nations. The Chinese government also imposes rules requiring newly found software vulnerabilities to be reported to a database operated by the MSS, ensuring early access to these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The MSS’s success in improving its talent pipeline and volume of offensive hackers has given it a significant advantage in cyber operations. This strategic approach allows China to potentially disrupt U.S. communications, power, and infrastructure in future conflicts, making it a major concern for Washington.</p>

<h2 id="li-qiangs-speech-at-the-united-nations-portraying-china-as-a-guardian-of-peace-and-security">Li Qiang’s Speech at the United Nations, Portraying China as a Guardian of Peace and Security</h2>

<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the United Nations General Assembly, portraying China as a defender of global peace, security, and multilateralism. He criticized unilateral and protectionist measures, implicitly referring to U.S. trade policies under the Trump administration. Li emphasized China’s commitment to global cooperation and openness, contrasting it with the disruptive policies of the U.S. He also highlighted China’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support for peace talks in various global conflicts. Li met with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and tech billionaire Bill Gates, advocating for global cooperation and deeper U.S.-China ties. China’s actions at the U.N. aim to position itself as a leader in global institutions amid U.S. retreat. Relations between China and the U.S. have stabilized, with plans for a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. China has also pledged to no longer claim trade benefits as a developing nation at the WTO, aiming to be seen as a champion of fair trade.</p>

<h2 id="the-passing-of-john-k-gong-a-us-lawyer-who-deeply-plowed-the-chinese-legal-field">The Passing of John K. Gong: A US Lawyer Who Deeply Plowed the Chinese Legal Field</h2>

<p>Jerome A. Cohen, a pioneering figure in the study of China’s legal system, died at 95. He was one of the first foreign lawyers to practice in China and was known for his advocacy against human rights abuses. Cohen’s career began conventionally as a law professor, but he shifted his focus to Chinese law after an opportunity arose to study the language and legal system. He taught at Harvard Law School and later at New York University, where he founded the U.S.-Asia Law Institute. Cohen’s work involved advising foreign companies and educating Chinese officials on commercial law. He remained vocal about China’s repressive policies under President Xi Jinping until his death. His contributions to the field of Chinese law and his support for human rights activists were widely recognized.</p>

<h2 id="the-cry-of-youth-the-voice-of-protest-ignites-the-asian-spring">The Cry of Youth: The Voice of Protest Ignites the “Asian Spring”</h2>

<p>A new wave of resistance is sweeping across South and Southeast Asia, driven by young people who are using social media to organize and express their grievances. This movement, reminiscent of the Arab Spring, is fueled by widespread youth unemployment, economic crises, and corruption. In countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal, young protesters have overthrown or challenged existing governments, often in response to severe economic hardships and political oppression.</p>

<p>The protests are characterized by a lack of traditional leadership and ideology, relying instead on digital solidarity and platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The absence of credible leftist or progressive movements has left a void that these young activists are filling with their own decentralized, fluid, and effective strategies. The state’s response, including censorship and violence, has often exacerbated the situation, pushing more young people onto the streets.</p>

<p>The article highlights specific events that triggered these uprisings, such as economic crises in Sri Lanka, youth unemployment in Bangladesh, and labor rights issues in Indonesia. The protests have turned violent in many cases, not initially by the protesters but as a reaction to state brutality. This has led to a broader political awakening among the youth, who are now demanding accountability for state violence and systemic change.</p>

<p>The article warns that without credible alternatives to channel the anger, the region could face chaos, including military coups and sectarian violence. However, it also notes a sense of difference this time, as Asia’s Generation Z is treating digital organizing as politics itself, building a new, decentralized movement from scratch. The power of this movement is evident, and those in power ignore it at their peril.</p>

<h2 id="is-chinas-farewell-to-green-involution-a-blessing-or-a-curse">Is China’s Farewell to Green “Involution” a Blessing or a Curse?</h2>

<p>China’s rapid rise as a green-industrial powerhouse has significantly impacted global climate efforts. Despite the rich world’s waning interest in climate change, China has driven 93% of global power additions from renewables, with 74% of wind and solar projects worldwide being built by China. This shift has geopolitical implications, potentially leading to a new eco-ideological Cold War. However, recent developments suggest China may be slowing its green investments due to domestic issues like “involution,” where intense price competition has led to overcapacity and financial strain. President Xi Jinping has called for an end to this, focusing on a new industrial strategy. Meanwhile, the U.S. is experiencing a shift in its approach to China, moving from confrontation to a more regional focus, which some see as an admission of geopolitical weakness. The U.S. has also faced setbacks in the high-end chip market, with China now producing competitive domestic alternatives. The future of global climate efforts and geopolitical dynamics hangs in the balance as these shifts unfold.</p>

<h2 id="a-buzzword-that-terrifies-china">A Buzzword That Terrifies China</h2>

<p>China’s intense market competition, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and lithium batteries, has led to price wars, losses, and bad debt. This situation is pushing China toward deflation, reminiscent of Japan’s economic struggles in the 1990s. Chinese leaders attribute this to “involution,” a term describing reckless domestic competition, and are attempting to control it through administrative measures. However, these measures are seen as temporary fixes for a deeper problem: China’s economy relies heavily on investment rather than consumer spending, leading to massive surpluses that harm profits domestically and provoke trade wars abroad.</p>

<p>The term “involution” gained popularity during the pandemic, used by young people to describe economic pressures. Initially dismissed as a Western capitalist issue, it became a significant concern in 2024 when Chinese manufacturers faced severe financial losses and low-priced exports led to tariffs from the U.S. and Europe. The Chinese government has since prioritized combating involution, framing it as a domestic issue rather than a response to Western pressure.</p>

<p>China’s approach to addressing oversupply involves government control rather than market mechanisms. Regulators have warned various industries against excessive price cutting and are planning measures like creating a polysilicon cartel to ease price wars. However, these interventions are often short-lived and may not address the root causes of the problem.</p>

<p>Longstanding policies encouraging excess supply remain unchanged, and local officials are still evaluated based on economic growth and social stability. This means maintaining local companies to ensure jobs and tax revenue. A decade ago, a similar campaign to reduce steel oversupply failed, as obsolete mills were closed while new, subsidized facilities were built, leading to increased steel production and higher U.S. tariffs.</p>

<p>China needs more domestic spending to absorb excess supply, but the government is reluctant to reduce its control over the economy. Private consumption in China is significantly lower than in the U.S. and Germany, partly due to heavy household savings to compensate for a weak social safety net. Suggestions to stimulate consumer spending, such as tax cuts and increased pensions, have been made but not fully implemented.</p>

<p>China’s current approach may not be sufficient to drive growth, risking a period of stagnation similar to Japan’s. The government’s reliance on administrative measures and resistance to market-driven solutions could lead to prolonged economic challenges.</p>

<h2 id="h-1b-visa-fees-skyrocket-china-introduces-k-visa-to-compete-for-talent">H-1B Visa Fees Skyrocket, China Introduces K Visa to Compete for Talent</h2>

<p>China is launching a new visa, the K visa, to attract top scientific talent from around the world, particularly from the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This move comes as the Trump administration in the United States has significantly increased the cost of H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The K visa aims to make it easier for graduates of top universities to travel to China for study or business, offering longer stays, multiple entries, and no requirement for an invitation letter from a company.</p>

<p>China’s efforts to attract foreign talent are part of a broader campaign to compete with the United States for technological and geopolitical dominance. While the U.S. has been criticized for attacking universities, slashing federal research funding, and questioning scientific authority, China has invested heavily in research and development and has successfully lured some top U.S. scientists to positions in China.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, China still faces challenges in attracting large pools of foreign talent due to language barriers, political and cultural differences, and limited pathways to permanent residency. The K visa is unlikely to replace the H-1B visa, as the majority of H-1B visa holders in the U.S. are Indian, and relations between China and India are complex. Additionally, Chinese social media responses to the new visa have included racist comments, indicating a lack of welcome for Indian talent.</p>

<p>China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has emphasized the need for self-reliance, aiming to shield against geopolitical uncertainties and hostile foreign powers. The K visa is seen as a gesture to position China as more open to the world, while the U.S. appears to be closing itself off. However, the visa’s impact on the global talent race remains uncertain, as details about eligibility and employment opportunities have not been fully disclosed.</p>

<h2 id="what-price-will-chinas-green-energy-ambition-bring-to-the-world">What Price Will China’s Green Energy Ambition Bring to the World?</h2>

<p>China’s green energy ambitions are transforming the global energy landscape, with significant implications for both climate and geopolitics. China has become the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, wind turbines, and battery capacity, investing $625 billion in clean tech in 2024. This dominance is evident in projects like the Monsoon Wind Power Project in Laos, which is the largest onshore wind farm in Southeast Asia. However, while these projects reduce global carbon emissions, they also create dependencies and potential debt traps for countries like Laos, which relies heavily on Chinese investment and technology.</p>

<p>China’s clean energy exports are rapidly expanding, particularly in developing nations, which drove 70% of China’s export growth in solar, wind, and electric vehicles over the past four years. This trend is expected to accelerate, with Chinese products entering new countries at unprecedented speeds and scales. Despite this dominance, China struggles to convert its clean tech leadership into soft power, often focusing on market penetration rather than building local clean-tech economies.</p>

<p>The U.S., under the Trump administration, has retreated from clean energy investments, further solidifying China’s global leadership in this sector. This shift has significant geopolitical implications, as China’s influence in clean energy could reshape global power dynamics. However, China’s approach to green energy is driven by both environmental concerns and strategic interests, including energy security and economic growth.</p>

<p>China’s green energy initiatives, while beneficial for reducing global emissions, also pose challenges. Countries like Laos, which have become reliant on Chinese investment, face the risk of debt traps and economic dependence. The future of global clean energy leadership will depend on how China balances its economic and geopolitical interests with the need for sustainable development and environmental stewardship.</p>

<h2 id="chinas-industrial-robot-annual-installation-exceeds-the-rest-of-the-world-combined">China’s Industrial Robot Annual Installation Exceeds the Rest of the World Combined</h2>

<p>China is leading the world in the installation and manufacturing of industrial robots, surpassing all other countries combined. Last year, China had over 2 million robots in its factories and installed nearly 300,000 new ones, compared to 34,000 in the United States. The Chinese government has played a significant role in this growth through public capital and policy directives, aiming to make China a leader in robotics and related technologies like semiconductors and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The global trend of increasing robot and AI use in manufacturing is transforming factories, making them more efficient and altering the roles of workers. China’s push for factory automation has been a key factor in its rise as the world’s manufacturing powerhouse. Since 2017, China has installed over 150,000 robots annually, contributing to a significant increase in manufacturing output. By early this year, China produced nearly a third of all manufactured goods worldwide.</p>

<p>China’s strategy, part of its “Made in China 2025” initiative, has involved providing industries with low-interest loans, government funding, and support for acquiring foreign competitors. This has resulted in China’s share of global robot manufacturing rising to a third of the market, surpassing Japan. However, China still relies on imported components for some advanced technologies, particularly in humanoid robots.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, China has a strong advantage in factory robots due to its large pool of skilled workers and a robust AI industry focused on optimizing factory performance. The country’s AI capabilities are being used to monitor and improve the efficiency of factory equipment, giving Chinese companies a competitive edge.</p>

<h2 id="recording-and-protecting-old-shanghai-the-american-diplomat-chiang-si-hong">Recording and Protecting “Old Shanghai”: The American Diplomat Chiang Si-hong</h2>

<p>Tess Johnston, a former U.S. foreign service officer, died at 93. She was known for her efforts to preserve Shanghai’s colonial architecture. Johnston documented her experiences in South Vietnam during the war and later focused on Shanghai’s vanishing colonial buildings. She co-founded Historic Shanghai in 1998 with Tina Kanagaratnam and Patrick Cranley to safeguard the city’s pre-Communist revolution architecture and culture. Johnston authored over two dozen books on architectural history and walking tours, including “A Last Look: Western Architecture in Old Shanghai.” She also recorded oral histories and collected ephemera, donating her archives to Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. Johnston served at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai from 1981 to 1996 and remained in the city until 2016. She was born in North Carolina and joined the foreign service in 1953. Johnston’s work highlighted the importance of preserving Shanghai’s historic cityscape before it changed beyond recognition.</p>

<h2 id="trump-signs-executive-order-to-clear-path-for-tiktok-deal">Trump Signs Executive Order to Clear Path for TikTok Deal</h2>

<p>President Trump signed an executive order to facilitate a deal allowing a coalition of investors to run an American version of TikTok, separate from its Chinese owner, ByteDance. This move aims to keep TikTok operational in the U.S. while addressing concerns about data security and propaganda. The deal, valued at $14 billion, involves non-Chinese investors and is intended to comply with a federal law that banned TikTok in January. The order extends the negotiation period until mid-January 2026.</p>

<p>Key investors include Oracle, Silver Lake, and potentially an Emirati investment firm, MGX. MGX’s involvement is part of a broader effort by the Emiratis to invest in the U.S. economy, including a $2 billion cryptocurrency investment in a Trump family-backed startup. The Emiratis have also been pushing for the sale of valuable AI chips from the U.S., which was previously restricted by the Biden administration.</p>

<p>The deal has raised ethical concerns, with Democratic senators requesting investigations into potential violations of ethics rules by Trump administration officials. Despite these concerns, the deal is seen as a way to ensure TikTok’s continued operation in the U.S. with enhanced data security and reduced propaganda risks.</p>

<h2 id="super-typhoon-hagibis-sweeps-through-hong-kong-taiwan-and-other-regions-causing-multiple-deaths">Super Typhoon “Hagibis” Sweeps Through Hong Kong, Taiwan and Other Regions, Causing Multiple Deaths</h2>

<p>Typhoon Ragasa, a powerful storm, caused significant damage and loss of life across Hong Kong, Taiwan, and southern China. The typhoon, which reached wind speeds of 165 miles per hour, resulted in 18 deaths and dozens of injuries as it passed through the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In Guangdong Province, China, over one million people were evacuated, and the authorities deployed 38,000 firefighters and 400 emergency teams. The storm caused severe flooding and infrastructure damage, including the collapse of a bridge in Taiwan and the flooding of coastal areas in Hong Kong. The typhoon is expected to continue westward, potentially affecting Vietnam and Laos, although it is likely to weaken. The storm’s impact has been exacerbated by climate change, which has led to higher sea and atmospheric temperatures, resulting in more intense typhoons.</p>

<p>A curator from Myanmar, known as Sai, had to flee Thailand after organizing an art exhibition in Bangkok that criticized authoritarian governments, including China. The exhibition, titled “Constellation of Complicity,” featured works from artists in Myanmar, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, among others. The show was intended to highlight how authoritarian regimes collaborate on issues like weapons, surveillance, and repression.</p>

<p>Two days after the exhibition opened in July, Sai received warnings from the museum directors that Thai police were seeking his contact details. Fearing arrest and deportation back to Myanmar, Sai fled to London, leaving his belongings behind. The museum directors later informed Sai that Chinese authorities had demanded the removal of works and names of four artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, which are politically sensitive regions under tight Chinese control. The museum complied, covering the artists’ names with thick black lines and removing symbols of Tibetan and Uyghur independence.</p>

<p>China has a history of pressuring cultural institutions overseas to comply with its censorship demands. In this case, the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok faced no resistance from Thai officials. The Thai Foreign Ministry and Bangkok city officials had warned the museum that the exhibition could cause diplomatic tensions with China, which is Thailand’s largest trading partner and a significant source of tourism.</p>

<p>The exhibition aimed to illustrate how authoritarian regimes cooperate on various issues, including a devastating civil war in Myanmar. Despite the censorship, the exhibition continued to run until October 19. The curator, Sai, plans to bring the show to countries where it can be staged without censorship and expressed no regrets about his actions, despite the risks involved.</p>

<h2 id="chinas-first-commitment-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions">China’s First Commitment to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>

<p>China has announced its first detailed target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to cut carbon dioxide and other pollutants by 7-10% by 2035. This announcement was made by President Xi Jinping at a United Nations climate summit. Previously, China had only pledged to peak its emissions around 2030, but recent studies suggest that emissions have already plateaued, five years earlier than expected.</p>

<p>Xi also announced plans to increase the proportion of non-fossil fuels in China’s energy system to over 30% within the next decade, focusing on solar, wind, and hydropower. China aims to expand its wind and solar capacity sixfold from 2020 levels, reaching 3,600 gigawatts, and make electric cars mainstream in new sales.</p>

<p>China’s new climate targets are significant because it is the world’s largest polluter. The targets contrast sharply with the United States’ stance under the Trump administration, which has repudiated climate action. China’s announcement also nudges other major polluters, like the European Union and India, to submit new 2035 targets under the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Climate advocates note that China’s steps alone are not sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement’s goals but suggest that China may exceed its targets. China has become a global leader in clean energy, investing heavily in renewable energy projects worldwide. This transformation is reshaping global economics and geopolitics.</p>

<p>China dominates the production of key minerals for renewable energy technology and leads in solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. The scale of its production has driven down prices, making solar and wind energy cheaper than fossil fuels in many countries. China also leads in electric vehicle production and is setting up factories globally.</p>

<p>China’s energy trajectory mirrors its rise as a global power. Initially, it relied heavily on coal, but it is now rapidly adding renewable energy to its grid. Independent analysts see a significant tipping point in China’s emissions, with signs that its greenhouse gas emissions are flattening out. This is crucial for global efforts to limit temperature increases to manageable levels.</p>

<p>China has also stopped building or financing coal-burning power plants abroad, focusing instead on promoting clean energy technologies. This shift is part of a broader global effort to combat climate change, with China playing a pivotal role.</p>

<h2 id="your-country-is-going-to-hell-trump-insults-the-world">“Your Country Is Going to Hell”: Trump “Insults” the World</h2>

<p>Trump delivered a 56-minute speech at the United Nations, criticizing environmentalists, insulting the Muslim mayor of London, and attacking allies and foes globally. He questioned the purpose of the United Nations and claimed that the U.S. military would act as judge, jury, and executioner against drug smugglers. He also criticized efforts to address climate change, calling it a “greatest con job” and claiming environmentalists want to eliminate cows. Trump announced a new effort to enforce the biological weapons convention using AI verification and called for a cessation of nuclear weapons development. He also praised his role in bringing about peace agreements and criticized the U.N. for not doing more. Despite his harsh rhetoric, world leaders greeted his speech with polite applause and sought one-on-one meetings with him.</p>
