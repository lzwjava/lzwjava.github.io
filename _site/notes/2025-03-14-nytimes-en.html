  <h2 id="xi-jinpings-willingness-to-concede-on-tiktok">Xi Jinping’s Willingness to Concede on TikTok</h2>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Trump discussed the TikTok deal during a phone call, with Xi indicating support for a mutually beneficial commercial deal. This discussion highlights Beijing’s strategy to offer symbolic wins to Trump, such as saving TikTok, in exchange for more negotiating room on key issues like tariffs, technology, and Taiwan. China views TikTok as a bargaining chip, less important than other economic and technological concerns. The Chinese government described the conversation as positive and constructive, with Xi emphasizing respect for market rules and Chinese law. Trump mentioned a potential meeting in South Korea and a visit to China, though Beijing’s summary did not confirm these plans. China aims to leverage its control over critical minerals and other economic strengths to gain leverage in negotiations. Despite risks, China seeks to ensure a stable and predictable relationship with the U.S., hoping to show that the U.S. is more eager for a deal. The leaders’ conversation suggests a stabilizing relationship, but the outcome depends on their upcoming in-person meeting.</p>

<h2 id="tiktok-deal-details-surface-trump-extends-deadline-again">TikTok Deal Details Surface, Trump Extends Deadline Again</h2>

<p>President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok to find a new owner or face a ban in the U.S. until December 16. This is the fourth extension and may be the final one, as a deal framework has been reached to address national security concerns. The deal involves ByteDance spinning off TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new company, with some existing investors maintaining their stakes and new U.S. investors reducing Chinese ownership to less than 20%. Oracle is expected to be one of the new investors. The deal requires approval from Beijing, which has resisted efforts to find a new buyer amid tense trade negotiations. The U.S. Congress passed a law last year to ban TikTok unless it finds a new, non-Chinese owner, citing national security threats. Trump’s actions have raised questions about presidential power and the rule of law.</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-the-dim-sum-lady-hong-kongs-traditional-yum-cha-culture-fades-into-memory">The End of the Dim Sum Lady: Hong Kong’s Traditional Yum Cha Culture Fades into Memory</h2>

<p>Hong Kong’s iconic dim sum cart ‘aunties’ are set to make their final rounds as the Metropol, one of the city’s largest dim sum restaurants, prepares to close after 35 years. The closure marks the end of a beloved tradition where middle-aged women, known as dim sum cart aunties, push carts filled with bamboo steamers of small, delicious dishes through the restaurant, interacting with customers in a way that adds a personal touch to the dining experience.</p>

<p>The Metropol, one of the few remaining restaurants that still use carts, has been a staple of Hong Kong’s dining scene. The dim sum cart aunties, like So Yim-ha, have become synonymous with the dim sum experience, offering dishes such as pork ribs, beef meatballs, and quail egg siu mai. Their friendly and outgoing nature, along with their ability to recommend dishes, has made them a cherished part of the city’s culinary culture.</p>

<p>The closure reflects Hong Kong’s changing economic landscape. Large restaurants like the Metropol, which thrived during the high-flying decades of the 1980s and 1990s, are now struggling. The rise of hotels capturing the wedding banquet business, a sluggish Chinese economy, and competition from lower-priced dining options in neighboring Shenzhen have all contributed to the decline. The Metropol’s closure is a poignant reminder of a bygone era and the end of a cherished tradition in Hong Kong’s dining culture.</p>

<h2 id="a-cold-standoff-triggered-by-china-new-zealand-and-the-cook-islands-face-a-test">A Cold Standoff Triggered by China: New Zealand and the Cook Islands Face a Test</h2>

<p>The Cook Islands and New Zealand, traditionally close allies, are now in a tense standoff due to the Cook Islands’ partnership agreement with China. This agreement, signed this year, has raised concerns in New Zealand about China’s expanding influence in the South Pacific. New Zealand has suspended millions of dollars in aid to the Cook Islands, leading to budgetary issues and threats from Cook Islands’ Prime Minister Mark Brown to seek alternative sources for infrastructure needs. Protests have erupted in Rarotonga, the main island, over fears of strained ties with New Zealand.</p>

<p>The dispute centers on New Zealand’s belief that the Cook Islands should have consulted them before signing the agreement with China. New Zealand has stated that no new aid will be provided until steps are taken to repair the relationship and restore trust. However, Cook Islands’ Prime Minister Brown has pointed out that New Zealand itself signed a partnership agreement with China in 2014 without consulting the Cook Islands, reaping significant economic benefits.</p>

<p>New Zealand’s growing wariness of China’s intentions in the region has been fueled by China’s use of coercive trade measures against Australia, test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific, and naval drills in waters between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, has described the Cook Islands-China deal as fitting a pattern of Beijing’s regional ambitions.</p>

<p>The paused funding, worth 18.2 million New Zealand dollars, was intended for health, education, and tourism, while a separate 3 million dollars in aid for cybersecurity continues. Analysts view New Zealand’s move as extraordinary, contrasting with Australia’s increased aid spending in the region. The Cook Islands, self-governing since 1965 but reliant on New Zealand for defense, faces a test of its relationship boundaries as China deepens its presence in the Pacific.</p>

<p>China’s security agreement with the Solomon Islands in 2022 heightened fears of Beijing aiming to establish a military foothold in the region. Both Chinese and Cook Islands officials have denied that their pact includes security or military matters. New Zealand’s intelligence chief warned of China’s ambition to link economic and security cooperation, creating competing regional architectures. China’s embassy in Wellington dismissed these claims as disinformation.</p>

<p>The Cook Islands, one of the smallest Pacific island nations, is also a focal point of emerging competition over seabed mining. The agreement with China includes pledges to cooperate on exploring seabed minerals, and the United States recently reached its own deal with the Cook Islands on sea floor mining. The Cook Islands, facing developmental challenges and climate change risks, needs support from wherever it can get it, with China having built key infrastructure in the capital, Avarua.</p>

<h2 id="the-high-cost-of-offending-trump">The High Cost of Offending Trump</h2>

<p>ABC电视台停播了吉米·坎摩尔的深夜秀，原因是联邦通信委员会主席布兰登·卡尔对坎摩尔在节目中关于特朗普总统和MAGA运动的言论表示不满。卡尔威胁要采取行动，ABC电视台迅速停播了坎摩尔的节目。坎摩尔在节目中批评了MAGA运动试图将枪杀右翼活动人士查理·柯克的嫌疑人泰勒·罗宾逊定性为与他们无关的人，并指责他们试图从中捞取政治资本。</p>

<p>特朗普政府和其盟友一直在使用各种手段迫使新闻和娱乐机构就范，包括提起诉讼、威胁经济利益等。这种压力导致了多个媒体和娱乐节目的停播或改变，如斯蒂芬·科尔伯特的深夜秀和《南方公园》的重播被撤下。这种现象引发了对言论自由和媒体独立性的广泛担忧。</p>

<p>媒体和娱乐界的从业者面临着巨大的压力，许多人选择谨言慎行，避免触犯特朗普及其盟友。这种环境下，媒体的言论自由受到严重威胁，尽管法律上没有明确的限制，但企业的自律和经济压力使得媒体在实际操作中失去了自由。</p>

<h2 id="china-russia-iran-spread-conspiracy-theories-over-khashoggi-murder">China, Russia, Iran Spread Conspiracy Theories Over Khashoggi Murder</h2>

<p>Russia, China, and Iran have spread thousands of false or inflammatory claims about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, aiming to exacerbate political divisions in the U.S. and portray the country as dysfunctional. Official state media in these countries mentioned Kirk 6,200 times from September 10 to 17, framing the killing as a conspiracy. Utah Governor Spencer Cox noted that these countries are exploiting the event to spread disinformation and encourage violence. Foreign influence campaigns have become common in the U.S., with Russia, China, and Iran using such events to push their geopolitical agendas. The assassination of Kirk generated a flood of false claims and conspiracy theories, both domestically and from foreign adversaries. Russia’s RT channel and prominent figures like Aleksandr Dugin spread unsubstantiated claims, while Iran and China also propagated their own narratives. These actions underscore the broader strategy of undermining American democracy and its global reputation.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-to-de-sinification-vietnams-footwear-industry-copying">The Path to De-Sinification? Vietnam’s Footwear Industry “Copying”</h2>

<p>China, once the world’s leading manufacturer of cars, toys, and computers, is losing its dominance in the sneaker industry to Vietnam. Major brands like Nike, Adidas, and Brooks now produce most of their globally sold sneakers in Vietnam, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City. This shift is driven by lower costs and wages, as well as Vietnam’s favorable investment environment and growing young workforce. The move began in the 1970s when brands like Nike started using factories in South Korea and Taiwan, then shifted to China in the 1980s. However, China’s rising labor costs and intellectual property issues prompted brands to look for alternatives. Vietnam’s economic reforms and government support for foreign investment made it an attractive option. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift, as companies realized their heavy reliance on China for raw materials and components. Despite some materials still coming from China, Vietnam’s supply chain is increasingly independent. The initial trade pact between the U.S. and Vietnam in July 2025 aims to address concerns about transshipped goods, but many questions remain.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-best-strategy-to-reverse-the-taiwan-strait-situation">Trump’s Best Strategy to Reverse the Taiwan Strait Situation</h2>

<p>The article discusses the escalating tensions between the United States and China over Taiwan, highlighting a dangerous feedback loop where Taiwanese defiance provokes aggressive responses from Beijing, leading to stronger U.S. support for Taiwan. This cycle has increased the risk of conflict and made Taiwan a central issue in U.S.-China relations.</p>

<p>The author suggests that Donald Trump, as a norm-defying president, is uniquely positioned to reverse this trend. The best strategy for Trump to avoid war would be to seek a fresh deal with China, restoring equilibrium across the Taiwan Strait. This could involve dialing back U.S. defense buildups in the region and making it clear to Taiwan that American military support is neither assured nor boundless.</p>

<p>The article notes that a similar approach worked in the 1970s, when the U.S. and China reached a nuanced compromise that allowed for stability and prosperity in the region. However, recent actions by Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. President Joe Biden have exacerbated tensions. Trump’s administration has shown some restraint, but the author suggests he should go further by reaffirming U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence, reimposing restrictions on diplomatic contact, and removing U.S. military trainers and weapon systems from Taiwan.</p>

<p>China, too, is advised to take reciprocal steps, such as declaring no timeline for unification with Taiwan and scaling back military threats and trade sanctions. The proposal is seen as politically risky for Trump but feasible given his control over the Republican Party and Congress. The article concludes that preventing a war would secure Trump’s place in history as a peacemaker, as a conflict between the U.S. and China would have no winners.</p>

<h2 id="trump-is-mimicking-the-chinese-model-and-its-a-disaster">Trump Is Mimicking the Chinese Model, and It’s a Disaster</h2>

<p>The Trump administration is attempting to transform the U.S. economy into a model similar to China’s, which combines private-sector development with significant government control. This approach is criticized as detrimental, as it undermines the pillars of America’s economic success: innovation, a large market, and stable rule of law. The article argues that while state intervention can be beneficial in certain contexts, such as infrastructure and national emergencies, it becomes harmful when it singles out individual companies or engages in political favoritism. This can lead to crony capitalism, where political connections rather than market-driven innovation determine success.</p>

<p>Examples of Trump’s actions include pushing for a “golden share” arrangement in a corporate merger, taking a stake in Intel, and using tariffs for political favoritism. These moves blur the line between private enterprise and state ownership, potentially damaging the economy. The article warns that such practices can stifle innovation and create a culture of fear and compliance, similar to what is seen in China, where entrepreneurship and risk-taking are discouraged.</p>

<p>The authors advocate for a renewed American model that encourages innovation, empowers entrepreneurs, and ensures fair distribution of risk and reward. They suggest that the government should create hands-off policies while companies take more responsibility for their employees and communities. The goal is to open more paths for people to build ownership through labor, investment, or entrepreneurship. The article concludes that adopting a state-controlled model, as seen in China, would be detrimental to the U.S. economy.</p>

<h2 id="soybeans-chinas-trade-war-weapon-and-americas-farmers-crisis">Soybeans, China’s Trade War Weapon and America’s Farmers’ Crisis</h2>

<p>North Dakota farmers, particularly those like the Gackle brothers, are facing a severe crisis due to China’s halt on purchasing American soybeans. This decision, a retaliation to U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, has led to significant financial losses for farmers who rely heavily on the Chinese market. The Gackle brothers’ 2,300-acre soybean farm is projected to lose $400,000 in 2025. The situation is exacerbated by high interest rates, input costs, and falling prices, reminiscent of the 1980s farm crisis.</p>

<p>The U.S. and China are set to discuss this issue during economic negotiations in Spain. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who owns extensive farmland in North Dakota, is leading these talks. While Bessent’s financial interests in the region raise potential conflicts of interest, he has pledged to push for China to fulfill its trade commitments. However, the situation remains dire for farmers, who are struggling to find storage for their soybeans and face potential long-term financial ruin.</p>

<p>The soybean supply chain, including grain elevators and transportation, is also disrupted. Farmers are scrambling to find extra storage and may need to sell their soybeans at a loss if no deal is reached. China has shown some interest in future purchases but is unlikely to relinquish its leverage over American farmers. The situation highlights the broader economic and political tensions between the U.S. and China, with significant implications for American agriculture.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-ai-companies-continuously-investing-in">What Are AI Companies Continuously Investing In?</h2>

<p>AI companies are investing heavily in building advanced AI technologies, with OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman predicting trillions of dollars in future spending on data centers. The industry is struggling to explain what they are building and why such massive investments are necessary. Potential goals include creating a superior search engine, enhancing office productivity, developing an all-encompassing digital assistant, and even achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) that matches or surpasses human intelligence.</p>

<p>Key visions and their feasibility:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better Search Engine</strong>: Chatbots like ChatGPT offer a more intuitive way to search for information but face challenges in profitability due to high operational costs and the difficulty of integrating digital advertising.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Productivity Tools</strong>: AI can generate code, summarize documents, and automate tasks, but widespread adoption is slow, and many businesses report no significant economic impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everything Assistant</strong>: Companies like Meta and Amazon are integrating AI into various products and services, aiming to control user interactions and increase engagement, though profitability remains uncertain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI Friends</strong>: Meta and other start-ups are developing AI companions for social interaction, but this technology is still years away from becoming a viable market and faces criticism for potentially harmful effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scientific Breakthroughs</strong>: Some believe AI could solve major scientific problems, but the path to achieving this is unclear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AGI and Superintelligence</strong>: Companies like Google and Meta are pursuing AGI, but the concept is hard to define, and true human-level AI is decades away. The industry is driven by a mix of greed, ego, and fear of missing out (FOMO), with significant risks involved.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="nostalgia-for-the-good-old-days-of-economic-growth">Nostalgia for the Good Old Days of Economic Growth</h2>

<p>A new catchphrase, “The Beauty of the Boom Years,” is trending on Chinese social media, reflecting a collective nostalgia for the economic boom years of the 2000s and early 2010s. Users on platforms like RedNote and Douyin share memories of vibrant fashion, upbeat music, and optimistic TV commercials from that era. This nostalgia contrasts sharply with the current economic slowdown, high youth unemployment, and stricter social controls, which have led to a sense of disillusionment among China’s younger generation.</p>

<p>The boom years, marked by China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were characterized by entrepreneurial energy, rising living standards, and abundant career opportunities. The optimism of that period is now seen as a stark contrast to the current environment, where risk-taking is discouraged and civil-service jobs are increasingly sought after for their stability.</p>

<p>The trend of celebrating the boom years is part of a broader Gen Z counterculture, reflecting their recognition that they may be the first generation in decades unlikely to surpass their parents’ standard of living. This disillusionment has manifested in various forms, including “lying flat” (refusing to join the rat race), “run philosophy” (emigrating for better prospects), and “let it rot” (giving up on difficult goals).</p>

<p>The government has taken notice of this youth discontent, with the Communist Party’s official newspaper, People’s Daily, criticizing the “lying flat” mentality. Despite the government’s efforts to instill optimism, many young people find it easier to be nostalgic about the past than hopeful about the present. The nostalgia for the boom years serves as an implicit criticism of the current state of affairs, highlighting the gap between the past optimism and the present reality.</p>

<h2 id="trump-sues-the-new-york-times-for-defamation-times-suppressing-independent-reporting">Trump Sues The New York Times for Defamation, Times: Suppressing Independent Reporting</h2>

<p>Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its reporters, alleging defamation ahead of the 2024 election. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, claims that a series of articles and a book published by two of the journalists were designed to damage Trump’s business, personal, and political reputation. The complaint seeks at least $15 billion in damages, asserting that the publications were made with “actual malice” and caused significant economic losses.</p>

<p>The defendants include The New York Times Company, reporters Susanne Craig, Russ Buettner, Peter Baker, and Michael S. Schmidt, as well as Penguin Random House, which published a book about Trump by Craig and Buettner. The lawsuit alleges that the timing of the publications was intended to inflict maximum electoral damage on Trump.</p>

<p>The New York Times has responded by stating that the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting. The Times’ publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, described the lawsuit as “frivolous” and expressed concern over the growing anti-press campaign led by Trump and his administration. Penguin Random House also defended the book and its authors, standing by the values of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>This lawsuit is part of a series of legal actions taken by Trump against news outlets, including previous settlements with CBS News and ABC News. Trump has also sued The Wall Street Journal and threatened to sue The Times on multiple occasions. The lawsuit cites specific articles and a book that Trump claims are part of a pattern of falsehoods and defamation, including content from “Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success” and articles by Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt.</p>

<p>The complaint also criticizes The Times’ endorsement of Kamala Harris and alleges that the newspaper has a history of malicious and false portrayals of Trump. The case has been assigned to Judge Steven D. Merryday, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush.</p>

<p>The trade war between China and the United States began with rapid escalation of tariffs but has since seen both countries showing willingness to avoid shutting down trade. Despite this, progress in resolving trade differences has been minimal. China has maintained its own timetable and has faced a significant drop in exports to the U.S., but its overall exports have surged elsewhere. China’s trade surplus with the world is on track to be even larger this year despite U.S. tariffs. China has managed to avoid the steepest tariffs threatened by the U.S. but still faces significant tax burdens on its exports.</p>

<p>China’s strategy involves long-term investments in infrastructure across the developing world, which has helped it redirect trade from the U.S. to other regions. This has allowed China to keep its economy growing, although domestic economic weaknesses persist, including a real estate downturn and high youth unemployment. China’s media and internet controls have helped prevent widespread discussion about the trade war’s impact.</p>

<p>China has also found leverage points in the negotiations, such as suspending exports of rare earth metals and magnets to the U.S., which are crucial for various industries. Additionally, China has shown its displeasure with U.S. tariffs by halting soybean purchases, affecting American farmers. These actions demonstrate China’s significant leverage and willingness to use it in the trade dispute.</p>

<h2 id="robert-redford-hollywoods-unconventional-icon">Robert Redford: Hollywood’s Unconventional Icon</h2>

<p>Robert Redford, known for his iconic roles and striking appearance, was a quintessential leading man in Hollywood. He was celebrated for his effortless charm and versatility, able to elevate even the most nonsensical films. His career took a significant turn in 1969 when he bought land in Utah and named it Sundance, marking a shift from traditional Hollywood stardom.</p>

<p>Redford’s breakthrough came with the film “Barefoot in the Park” (1967), co-starring Jane Fonda. Despite the film’s flaws, Redford’s performance was praised. He quickly became a symbol of New Hollywood, starring in notable films like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969) and “The Way We Were” (1973). His roles often showcased his ability to handle both action and drama with ease.</p>

<p>Redford’s acting style was particularly effective when he seemed to do very little, allowing his presence to speak volumes. Films like “Three Days of the Condor” (1975) highlighted his ability to convey depth and complexity with minimal effort. He was also known for his comfort in sharing the screen with both male and female co-stars, as seen in his collaborations with Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman.</p>

<p>Despite his success, Redford was not immune to criticism. Some of his later films were considered middlebrow and forgettable. However, his public persona became more intriguing as he engaged in political activism and environmental causes. He made his directorial debut with “Ordinary People” (1980), which won multiple Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>

<p>Redford’s decision to found the Sundance Institute and festival was a significant move that changed American cinema. He created a space for artists to experiment and innovate, fostering a community that produced films he would never have starred in or directed himself. This initiative was a testament to his desire for independence and his commitment to something greater than personal fame.</p>

<h2 id="framework-agreement-on-tiktok-ownership">Framework Agreement on TikTok Ownership</h2>

<p>U.S. and Chinese officials reached a preliminary agreement on the future of TikTok, addressing a major point of contention between the two largest economies. The deal, described as a “framework,” involves divesting TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and transferring ownership to U.S.-controlled entities. The agreement is set to be approved by U.S. President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a scheduled call on Friday. The negotiations, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, along with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, took place over two days in Madrid. This was the fourth round of talks focusing on tariffs, trade, and other issues.</p>

<p>The U.S. had set a deadline for TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner or face a ban, but Trump has the power to delay or nullify this ban. The talks were intense, with China making “very aggressive asks” on TikTok. The negotiations also touched on China’s export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which are critical to U.S. manufacturers. The next round of trade talks is expected to take place in about a month.</p>

<p>The U.S. has been imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, initially at 145% and later reduced to 30%, while China has imposed 10% tariffs on American products. The latest pause on U.S. tariffs is set to expire in November. The escalating tensions include the U.S. adding Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist and China investigating U.S.-made microchips. The U.S. is also concerned about China’s restrictions on agricultural exports and the potential impact on U.S. farmers.</p>

<p>Despite robust trade figures, China’s domestic economy is showing signs of strain due to the trade war. Retail sales and industrial output in China slowed in August. The Chinese government is discouraging investments in overcapacity industries like electric vehicles to prevent price competition and ease concerns from trading partners.</p>

<h2 id="israel-launches-ground-offensive-in-gaza">Israel Launches Ground Offensive in Gaza</h2>

<p>Israel launched a ground offensive into Gaza City early Tuesday, aiming to take control of a key urban area despite the presence of hundreds of thousands of residents. The operation is in its early stages, according to two officials who spoke anonymously. The military action and intensified bombardment risk worsening the humanitarian crisis, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. Over 300,000 people had fled the city by Monday, and the military urged the remaining 500,000 Palestinians to evacuate south immediately. The Israeli military spokesperson stated that they had begun dismantling Hamas’ terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City. Israel’s defense minister described the situation as Gaza “burning” and emphasized the military’s aggressive strikes against terrorist infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="nvidia-accused-of-violating-anti-monopoly-law">NVIDIA Accused of Violating Anti-Monopoly Law</h2>

<p>China’s antitrust regulator has accused Nvidia, a leading U.S. chipmaker, of violating China’s antitrust laws. This announcement comes amid escalating tensions between China and the U.S., with both countries engaging in retaliatory actions. The U.S. had recently added 23 Chinese firms to a list of companies barred from buying American technology, while China is investigating American suppliers of integrated circuits. The investigation into Nvidia stems from a 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, where Nvidia allegedly failed to uphold commitments to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China. Nvidia maintains compliance with the law and will cooperate with relevant authorities. The Chinese government is increasingly using regulatory tools and diplomatic negotiations to gain access to advanced semiconductors and reduce dependence on foreign technology. This move is part of a broader effort to influence global antitrust norms and scrutinize foreign acquisitions in advanced tech industries. Nvidia’s global demand for its chips makes it a valuable company, but it is caught in the middle of a U.S.-China contest for AI dominance. The scrutiny on Nvidia comes as firms worldwide rely on its chips for advanced AI systems.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-moment-of-severe-social-division-in-the-united-states-trump-has-no-intention-of-bridging-the-gap">In a Moment of Severe Social Division in the United States, Trump Has No Intention of Bridging the Gap</h2>

<p>In an era of deep polarization in American society, President Trump has made it clear that unity is not his mission. Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, Trump initially followed the conventional presidential playbook, expressing condolences and mourning the loss. However, he quickly shifted to blaming the American left for the murder and vowing revenge. This stance was criticized even by some of his usual supporters. Trump has consistently avoided talking about healing the nation’s divisions and instead has escalated tensions, portraying those who disagree with him as enemies and traitors.</p>

<p>Trump’s approach reflects his long-standing belief that the left is the enemy and that his role is to fight against them. This perspective is shared by his former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who described Trump as a “wartime president” focused on eradicating domestic terrorists like ANTIFA. Trump’s rhetoric and actions have been characterized by a divisive and confrontational style, which he has maintained throughout his presidency.</p>

<p>Critics argue that Trump’s divisive politics have exacerbated the nation’s divisions, with both left-wing and right-wing voices contributing to the polarization. While other presidents have attempted to unite the country during times of crisis, Trump has chosen to inflame tensions. He has not invited Democratic leaders to the White House for talks and has not briefed them on major national security events, further isolating himself from bipartisan efforts.</p>

<p>Trump’s focus on catering to his core supporters and his consistent use of divisive rhetoric have been a defining characteristic of his presidency. He has referred to political rivals and journalists as “evil” and has shown situational outrage at inflammatory rhetoric, depending on who is making the statements. His concern for security against political violence has also been selective, pardoning supporters who stormed the Capitol and considering pardons for those involved in plots against Democratic officials.</p>

<p>Despite the calls for unity from some Republican leaders, Trump has continued to promote a divisive agenda, using incidents like the assassination of Charlie Kirk to further his narrative against the left. This approach has led to concerns about the escalation of political violence and the deepening of divisions within American society.</p>
