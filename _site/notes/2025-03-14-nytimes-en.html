  <h2 id="concerns-over-escalating-political-violence-in-the-us-after-kirks-assassination">Concerns Over Escalating Political Violence in the U.S. After Kirk’s Assassination</h2>

<p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk, a prominent right-wing activist, has heightened concerns about escalating political violence in the United States. Prior to his killing, there were already signs of a looming political crisis due to increasing polarization and the deterioration of public discourse. Acts of violence targeting figures on both the left and the right had been accumulating.</p>

<p>Kirk’s shooting on a Utah college campus has raised fears that the country may be entering a more dangerous phase. Social media reactions were starkly divided, with left-wing users celebrating his death and right-wing users calling for political reckoning and vengeance. Some even suggested that the country was on the brink of civil war.</p>

<p>Experts warn that Americans’ tolerance for politically motivated attacks is growing rapidly. The shooting was captured on video and quickly went viral, adding to the public’s shock and concern. This event follows another disturbing video of a young public transit rider being stabbed to death in North Carolina, which had become entangled in a national debate over Trump’s plans to send the military into Democratic-led cities to combat crime.</p>

<p>The political climate is highly charged, with President Trump and his opponents using inflammatory language. Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker, acknowledged the deep divisions and the pressure felt by both sides. Surveys show that a significant portion of Democrats and Republicans justify the use of force in political contexts.</p>

<p>Experts and political figures are calling for a rejection of political violence. Matthew Dowd, a political analyst, criticized Kirk’s divisive rhetoric, while Jesse Watters on Fox News called for retaliation. Trump initially responded with restraint, ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff, but later blamed the media and the “radical left” for Kirk’s murder.</p>

<p>The assassination has raised concerns about the potential mobilization of well-organized and trained right-wing groups, including militia organizations, which could be activated by political leaders. The situation highlights the urgent need for a de-escalation of tensions and a rejection of political violence.</p>

<h2 id="prominent-american-right-wing-youth-activist-and-trump-ally-kirk-shot-dead">Prominent American Right-Wing Youth Activist and Trump Ally Kirk Shot Dead</h2>

<p>Charlie Kirk, the founder of the prominent right-wing youth activist group Turning Point USA and a close ally of former President Trump, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. The incident sparked widespread grief and condemnation from both media figures and officials from both political parties, who called for an end to politically motivated violence. The FBI initially reported that a suspect was in custody, but Utah officials later clarified that the person detained was a person of interest and the investigation was ongoing. Utah Governor Spencer Cox described the shooting as a “political assassination.” President Trump mourned Kirk on social media, highlighting his influence and popularity. Kirk was shot about 20 minutes into his speech, and videos showed the chaotic aftermath. The investigation revealed that the initial person detained was not the gunman and was later charged with obstruction of justice. Videos from the rooftop of the Losee Center captured a person’s movements before and after the shooting, suggesting the shooter’s location. Both Democrats and Republicans swiftly condemned the violence, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling it “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.” Trump ordered American flags to be lowered to half-staff in Kirk’s honor. Kirk had become a significant figure in the right-wing movement, co-founding Turning Point USA in 2012 and frequently hosting large rallies on college campuses.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-charlie-kirk-trump-ally-shot-dead">Who is Charlie Kirk, Trump Ally Shot Dead?</h2>

<p>Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old influential figure in right-wing American politics, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was a key member of President Trump’s inner circle, known for his speaking abilities, fundraising, and loyalty. Kirk founded Turning Point USA, a conservative youth organization, and Turning Point Action, a political action group. He was a frequent visitor to the White House during Trump’s first term and was part of a group vetting prospective White House appointees after the 2024 election. Kirk was married to Erika Frantzve, a podcast host and former Miss Arizona, and they had two young children. He grew up in an affluent Chicago suburb and founded Turning Point USA at 18. Kirk was also known for his controversial statements and was accused of antisemitism, homophobia, and racism. Despite these controversies, he remained a loyal supporter of Trump and was close friends with Donald Trump Jr.</p>

<h2 id="what-kirks-death-means-to-trump-personally">What Kirk’s Death Means to Trump Personally</h2>

<p>Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, had a close personal relationship that began during Trump’s first term and deepened after his 2020 election loss. Kirk was a frequent presence in the Trump family and White House, known for his charisma, business skills, and fundraising abilities. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., played a key role in bringing Kirk into the family circle.</p>

<p>Kirk’s assassination in 2025 was a deeply personal loss for Trump, who publicly expressed his grief and anger. Trump himself announced Kirk’s death, a rare show of lament. Kirk was particularly close to Donald Trump Jr., who described him as a highly effective organizer and fundraiser. Kirk’s relationship with Trump grew stronger after the 2020 election, and he became a prominent voice spreading baseless claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>Kirk was careful in his interactions with Trump, often acting as a faithful custodian of the MAGA base. He occasionally disagreed with Trump but generally supported his decisions. Kirk’s influence extended to high-level personnel discussions and policy decisions, including the appointment of a top donor as ambassador to Luxembourg. Despite occasional disagreements, Kirk remained a trusted advisor and close ally to Trump until his death.</p>

<h2 id="how-kirk-inspires-young-men-to-feel-empowered">How Kirk Inspires Young Men to Feel Empowered</h2>

<p>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, gained significant influence among young men on college campuses despite not attending college himself. He addressed political and cultural issues with clear, often provocative, answers that resonated with young men feeling isolated and marginalized in a culture they perceived as oppressive. Kirk’s message of traditional values and criticism of progressive norms struck a chord with many who felt their views were not represented or were even suppressed. His boldness in speaking out against issues like transgender rights and the Civil Rights Act, along with his defense of Christian values, made him a polarizing figure. Kirk’s campus visits often sparked intense protests, but his supporters found his message empowering. His death in a shooting incident highlighted his impact on young men who felt he gave them the confidence to express their beliefs in a climate of “cancel culture.”</p>

<h2 id="nepal-protests-how-did-they-escalate-step-by-step">Nepal Protests: How Did They Escalate Step by Step?</h2>

<p>Nepal faced a power vacuum after widespread protests against corruption and economic inequality led to the resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and the deployment of army troops in the capital, Kathmandu. The protests, led by teenagers and young adults, were the largest since Nepal became a democratic republic in 2008. At least 22 people died, with 19 killed by security forces.</p>

<p>The protests were sparked by a government ban on 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and WeChat. This ban raised fears of restricted speech and negatively impacted tourism and remittances from overseas workers. The unrest was fueled by long-standing social and economic issues, including widespread corruption and economic hardship. A social media campaign exposing the luxurious lives of the elite’s children further ignited public anger.</p>

<p>The protests escalated rapidly, with security forces opening fire on demonstrators. Despite the government’s reversal of the social media ban, the unrest continued, leading to the burning of government buildings, the Supreme Court, and other key infrastructure. By the end of Tuesday, the prime minister and four other ministers had resigned.</p>

<p>The military was deployed to restore order, and a curfew was imposed. However, the situation remained unclear, with no clear leadership among the protesters and no specific demands. The military ordered the public to hand over any weapons taken during the protests and warned against hoarding weapons. The future of Nepal’s governance and the role of the military in setting up an interim government remained uncertain.</p>

<h2 id="trump-angers-longtime-allies-japan-and-south-koreas-trade-agreement-dissatisfaction-intensifies">Trump Angers Longtime Allies, Japan and South Korea’s Trade Agreement Dissatisfaction Intensifies</h2>

<p>In a span of 24 hours, President Trump angered both South Korea and Japan, two longtime U.S. allies, by enforcing strict immigration policies and signing a trade deal that gave him significant control over Japanese investments. The U.S. immigration officials raided a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia, arresting hundreds of South Korean citizens for illegal residence or work. Simultaneously, Trump signed an executive order formalizing a trade deal with Japan, which included a memorandum allowing Trump to dictate how Japan would invest $550 billion in the U.S. This move has sparked public anger and political backlash in both countries, with leaders questioning the value of complying with Trump’s demands. South Korea, in particular, is struggling to finalize the details of a trade agreement due to the public outcry and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of reduced tariffs. The situation highlights Trump’s aggressive use of trade negotiations to push his agenda, despite the diplomatic and economic consequences for U.S. allies.</p>

<h2 id="hong-kongs-lgbtq-rights-bill-overwhelmingly-rejected-by-legislative-council">Hong Kong’s LGBTQ+ Rights Bill Overwhelmingly Rejected by Legislative Council</h2>

<p>Hong Kong’s legislature overwhelmingly rejected a bill that would recognize same-sex partnerships and provide related rights, such as medical decision-making authority for partners. The vote, with 71 out of 89 legislators opposing the bill, was seen as a setback by activists who view it as a crucial step forward despite its limitations. The bill would have allowed same-sex couples married or in civil unions overseas to register in Hong Kong, granting them limited rights but not covering parental or adoption rights.</p>

<p>The opposition to the bill was led by pro-Beijing legislators, who argued that it could undermine traditional Chinese family values. Advocacy groups like Hong Kong Marriage Equality urged the government to reintroduce the bill after the legislative council elections in December. The rejection has put Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee, in a difficult position, as the city’s top court had ordered the government to pass such legislation by this fall.</p>

<p>Supporters of the bill argued that recognizing same-sex couples would enhance Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial hub and align with public opinion, which has shown increasing support for same-sex marriage over the years. Recent studies indicate that 60% of Hong Kong residents support same-sex marriage, up from 50% in 2017 and 38% in 2013.</p>

<p>The political opposition has left the future of same-sex rights in Hong Kong uncertain, with the government indicating it will respect the legislature’s decision but not seeking an extension of the court-imposed deadline. The rejection has been criticized by activists as a troubling signal that court rulings may be disregarded and individual dignity overlooked.</p>

<h2 id="will-he-dare-to-risk-again">Will he dare to risk again?</h2>

<p>Tao, an electronics repairman in his early 30s, attempted to escape China for the United States but was deported back to China after his asylum claim was rejected. He was part of a record-breaking wave of undocumented Chinese migrants who made harrowing journeys through Central America to reach the U.S. Many, including Tao, were not high-profile dissidents but ordinary Chinese individuals feeling suffocated by the government’s tightening grip and discouraged by dimming economic prospects.</p>

<p>Tao presented himself at the southern border in Texas and applied for political asylum, confident he would be accepted by a system he believed was open and liberal. However, his claim was denied despite a slightly higher success rate for Chinese applicants. The Biden administration’s tougher stance on illegal immigration contributed to his rejection.</p>

<p>Upon returning to China, Tao faced immediate challenges, including being questioned by customs officials and having his passport confiscated. He was also pressured to frame a fellow deportee for illegally arranging his journey. Tao’s life in China became increasingly difficult, with economic hardships and political surveillance. He was repeatedly questioned by state security officers and faced an exit ban, making it difficult for him to leave the country again.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Tao managed to secure a new passport and left China for a Southeast Asian country, where he found work in an electronics factory. He hopes to eventually move to Europe or Mexico. Tao’s story highlights the struggles of Chinese migrants seeking freedom and the harsh realities they face both in their home country and in their attempts to seek asylum abroad.</p>

<h2 id="charlie-kirks-death-america-moves-closer-to-losing-everything">Charlie Kirk’s Death: America Moves Closer to Losing Everything</h2>

<p>The article discusses the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, a prominent political figure, and the broader implications of political violence in the United States. It highlights several recent incidents of political violence, including attempts to kidnap governors, assaults on political figures, and the assassination of high-profile individuals. The author argues that the foundation of a free society is the ability to participate in politics without fear of violence, and that the recent escalation of political violence threatens this foundation.</p>

<p>Kirk is praised for his effective political engagement, particularly his efforts to persuade college students and shift their political views. Despite differing political beliefs, the author acknowledges Kirk’s contribution to maintaining the viability of American politics through his persuasive and fearless approach.</p>

<p>The article also critiques misguided reactions to Kirk’s murder, warning against using his death to justify further violence or to politicize his views. It emphasizes that political violence is contagious and can escalate to affect all sides, leading to a society of horrors and unfreedom.</p>

<p>The author concludes by stressing the importance of maintaining a political environment where disagreements are resolved through argument and words, not violence. The safety of political figures is crucial for the continued viability of American democracy, and the recent incidents underscore the need for vigilance against political violence.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-witnessing-the-self-destruction-of-a-scientific-superpower">We Are Witnessing the Self-Destruction of a Scientific Superpower</h2>

<p>The article discusses the decline of America’s scientific leadership, comparing it to the “duck and cover” drills of the 1950s, which were futile attempts to protect against nuclear attacks. The Trump administration’s cuts to federal funding for scientific and medical research are seen as a threat to America’s universities and its status as a global leader in science and technology. The article highlights that while the U.S. once responded to the Soviet Union’s Sputnik launch with a massive investment in education and research, the current response to China’s rise in scientific prowess is marked by division and indifference.</p>

<p>The article notes that China now dominates the top ranks of global research institutions, with eight out of the top ten institutions being Chinese. This shift is seen as a potential “Sputnik moment” for the U.S., but the response is lacking the unity and investment seen in the past. The Trump administration’s policies, including cuts to research funding and restrictions on immigration, are seen as detrimental to scientific progress and the future of American universities.</p>

<p>The National Defense Education Act (N.D.E.A.) of 1958 is cited as a pivotal moment that transformed American education and research, leading to significant advancements in various fields. The act not only bolstered STEM fields but also supported the humanities, fostering a culture of innovation and intellectual freedom. However, the current administration’s policies are seen as undermining these achievements, potentially leading to a loss of global admiration and scientific progress.</p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of American universities and their contributions to global scientific advancements. It calls for a renewed commitment to supporting these institutions, highlighting their role in attracting talented researchers from around the world and fostering a culture of innovation and risk-taking.</p>

<h2 id="us-navy-seals-secretly-infiltrated-north-korea-operation-failed-civilians-killed">U.S. Navy SEALs Secretly Infiltrated North Korea, Operation Failed, Civilians Killed</h2>

<p>In early 2019, a team of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 6’s Red Squadron was sent on a highly classified mission to plant an electronic device in North Korea to intercept communications of leader Kim Jong-un during high-level nuclear talks with President Trump. The mission was risky and required precise execution. The SEALs were to use mini-submarines to approach the shore and install the device, but they encountered a North Korean boat and opened fire, killing everyone on board. The SEALs retreated without completing their mission. The operation was never publicly acknowledged by the U.S. or North Korea and remained classified. The Trump administration did not notify key members of Congress about the mission, potentially violating the law. The mission was part of a broader effort to gain intelligence on North Korea’s nuclear program, which has continued to advance despite various U.S. efforts, including sanctions and diplomatic talks. The SEALs’ mission was intended to address a strategic blind spot in U.S. intelligence, but it ultimately failed due to unforeseen circumstances and communication blackouts. The mission’s failure and the killing of civilians raised concerns about the SEALs’ track record and the risks involved in such high-stakes operations.</p>

<h2 id="canceling-trump-tariffs-a-tax-cut-or-a-disaster-for-america">Canceling Trump Tariffs: A Tax Cut or a Disaster for America?</h2>

<p>The article discusses the economic implications of potentially canceling the tariffs imposed by President Trump, which are currently under review by the Supreme Court. Trump has warned that removing these tariffs would “destroy” the U.S. economy, while some economists argue that such a move could be akin to a corporate tax cut, benefiting American businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>Economists generally agree that American businesses and consumers bear the brunt of the tariff costs, either by absorbing them or passing them on to consumers through higher prices. Companies like General Motors have already reported significant financial impacts due to these tariffs.</p>

<p>The article highlights that the Supreme Court’s decision could have significant economic repercussions. If the tariffs are ruled illegal, it could free businesses from the tax burden and potentially return billions in tariff revenue to them, acting as a tax cut. However, the long-term effects are uncertain, as Trump could potentially reinstate similar tariffs using other authorities.</p>

<p>The economic landscape remains uncertain, with companies potentially delaying major hiring and investment decisions until the trade policy situation stabilizes. The end of current tariffs could also disrupt bond markets, which have factored in the revenue from import taxes to narrow the budget deficit. If the court orders the return of collected tariff revenue, it would provide a financial boost to companies, though it is unclear how they would use these funds.</p>

<h2 id="dji-drones-face-ban-in-the-us">DJI Drones Face Ban in the US</h2>

<p>American businesses are preparing for a potential ban on DJI drones, a major Chinese manufacturer, due to concerns over forced labor, unfair subsidies, and cybersecurity threats. DJI drones are widely used in various industries, including agriculture, construction, mining, and public safety. The ban is part of a broader effort to decouple the U.S. economy from China’s, as American manufacturers struggle to compete in the growing drone market.</p>

<p>The ban has already affected companies like nuWay Ag, which relies on DJI drones for its operations. The company has had to lay off employees due to difficulties in importing DJI drones. The ban, if implemented, would prevent new DJI products from receiving FCC licenses to fly, though existing drones would not be immediately affected.</p>

<p>DJI has requested a thorough examination of its drones to prove they do not transmit information to Chinese entities, but there has been no public sign of progress. The company has also considered manufacturing drones in the U.S. to address security concerns. However, some lawmakers and industry stakeholders view DJI as an unacceptable economic and national security risk.</p>

<p>American drone manufacturers are eager for DJI’s exit, seeing it as an opportunity to expand their market share. However, few U.S. companies produce consumer and industrial drones comparable to DJI’s products, focusing instead on higher-margin military and public safety markets. The ban could lead to higher costs and outdated technology for industries reliant on DJI drones, potentially harming sectors like agriculture, energy, and public safety.</p>

<h2 id="why-japanese-7-eleven-and-other-convenience-stores-are-so-special">Why Japanese 7-Eleven and Other Convenience Stores Are So Special</h2>

<p>Japan’s 7-Eleven and other convenience stores are integral to daily life, offering a wide range of services beyond just food and beverages. With over 55,000 stores nationwide, they serve millions of residents daily for food purchases, package sending, and bill payments. These stores are a highlight for tourists, with many sharing their experiences on social media.</p>

<p>7-Eleven, the largest chain, has nearly 22,000 stores across Japan and plans significant global expansion, particularly in North America. The chain began in 1927 in the U.S. and entered Japan in 1974, rapidly expanding to 100 stores within two years. By 1993, it had 5,000 stores, and in 2005, it became wholly Japanese-owned through Seven &amp; i Holdings. Today, 7-Eleven has over 83,000 stores globally, with more than 13,000 in the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<p>Japanese convenience stores offer more than just food; they provide services like document printing, ticket purchases, and act as community hubs, especially in rural areas where other services have closed. They are seen as safe spaces and provide essential supplies during natural disasters. Inside, stores are clean, well-organized, and stocked with a variety of fresh and seasonal items, including regional specialties. They also offer seating areas, hot water dispensers, and microwaves for customers.</p>

<p>The stores are not just for shopping but also for socializing and passing time. They are a lifeline for many, offering a sense of community and safety.</p>

<h2 id="starbucks-whirlwind-reforms-why-they-alienated-both-employees-and-customers">Starbucks’ Whirlwind Reforms: Why They Alienated Both Employees and Customers</h2>

<p>Starbucks’ recent changes, including the introduction of complex drinks like the Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino and new policies requiring baristas to greet customers and write personalized messages on cups, have frustrated both employees and customers. The new CEO, Brian Niccol, has implemented various strategies to revitalize the brand, such as eliminating charges for nondairy milk and investing in technology to speed up service. However, these changes have led to confusion and dissatisfaction among customers and employees, with some popular items being removed from the menu and then re-added.</p>

<p>Starbucks has faced declining sales and stock performance, with a 6.5% drop in shares over the past year. The company is also struggling in China, where it has lost market share to competitors like Luckin Coffee. Niccol is considering finding an investor to take a stake in the Chinese market. Additionally, the company is addressing long wait times by hiring more baristas and implementing a new order-sequencing system, but these measures are increasing labor costs and reducing profits.</p>

<p>Competitors like 7 Brew Coffee and Scooter’s Coffee are expanding rapidly, offering unique beverages that appeal to customers. Starbucks’ stock price has also been affected by rising coffee prices and tariffs. Despite these challenges, some employees and customers appreciate the new changes, such as the personalized messages on cups. However, others, like barista Brooke Allen, feel overwhelmed by the new policies and dress codes, leading to unionization efforts in some stores.</p>

<h2 id="stablecoin-pegged-to-the-renminbi-china-considers-a-trial-run-in-hong-kong">Stablecoin Pegged to the Renminbi? China Considers a Trial Run in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>China is considering testing a stablecoin pegged to the renminbi in Hong Kong. This move comes as digital currencies pose challenges to Beijing’s strict financial controls, while also offering opportunities for China to influence global payments. The global popularity of stablecoins, particularly those tied to the U.S. dollar, has raised concerns in China about the potential deepening of the dollar’s dominance. Chinese economists and regulators are divided on how to approach stablecoins, but a recent law in Hong Kong has set rules for issuing stablecoins, making it a controlled environment for testing.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has been experimenting with its own digital currency, the digital renminbi, since 2020, but adoption has been slow. The limited interest in the digital renminbi raises questions about the potential interest in a stablecoin tied to the Chinese currency. In Hong Kong, regulators will look for applicants to demonstrate the widespread use potential of their stablecoins as part of a sustainable business plan.</p>

<p>Chinese tech giants, including JD and Ant Group, have shown interest in applying for stablecoin licenses. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has received expressions of interest from 77 entities, including banks and technology companies. However, stablecoins are not expected to become a mainstream payment method in Hong Kong anytime soon, as residents already use multiple instant payment methods.</p>

<p>Despite political control from Beijing, Hong Kong remains a key connection point between China and the global financial system. The simultaneous development of stablecoin laws in the U.S. and Hong Kong highlights the growing recognition of stablecoins’ importance in the future of finance.</p>

<h2 id="chinas-exports-to-africa-surge-trade-with-us-plummets">China’s Exports to Africa Surge, Trade with U.S. Plummets</h2>

<p>China’s trade with Africa has surged, reaching a $60 billion surplus by 2025, driven by increased exports of batteries, solar panels, electric vehicles, and industrial equipment. This shift is partly due to U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, which have hindered trade with the U.S. and led to a 33% drop in Chinese exports to the U.S. in August 2025, while exports to Africa grew by 26%.</p>

<p>China has long been Africa’s largest trading partner, and this relationship has become even more crucial as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies and China’s domestic economic growth slows. Chinese products, particularly solar panels, dominate the African market due to their competitive pricing. This trend is evident in cities like Kampala, Uganda, where nearly all electronics and solar panels are Chinese-made.</p>

<p>China’s investment in African infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative has deepened its influence and created business opportunities. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has reduced foreign aid to Africa and imposed tariffs on many African countries, further pushing them towards China. Beijing has responded by waiving nearly all tariffs for 53 African countries, emphasizing its commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>

<p>The surge in Chinese exports to Africa includes not just solar energy but also steel, machinery, and consumer products like automobiles and smartphones. This influx of Chinese goods poses challenges for African countries, as it threatens their efforts to develop high-value industries. However, policymakers feel compelled to maintain good relations with China due to its dominant economic presence.</p>

<h2 id="report-china-is-the-driving-force-changing-the-global-energy-landscape">Report: China is the “Driving Force” Changing the Global Energy Landscape</h2>

<p>China’s aggressive efforts to sell batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines globally are significantly impacting the world’s energy landscape. Since 2010, China’s production scale has driven down the cost of these technologies by 60 to 90 percent. Last year, over 90 percent of new wind and solar projects worldwide produced power more cheaply than the cheapest fossil fuel alternatives. This cost advantage has made renewable energy more attractive, especially for poorer countries.</p>

<p>China’s dominance in clean energy industries is creating conditions for a decline in fossil fuel use. The country supplies 80 percent of global solar panels and 60 percent of wind turbines. This has allowed countries like Mexico, Bangladesh, and Malaysia to surpass the United States in using renewable energy for daily activities.</p>

<p>China’s push for renewable energy is driven by economic reasons and national security concerns, aiming to reduce reliance on oil imports. The global implications are significant, as reducing fossil fuel use is crucial for mitigating climate change. However, some countries may be hesitant to rely heavily on Chinese technology due to geopolitical reasons.</p>

<p>China’s own energy transition is also crucial. Despite still burning more coal than the rest of the world combined, China met 84 percent of its electricity demand growth with solar and wind power last year, reducing fossil fuel use by 2 percent. The country’s clean energy sector contributed nearly $2 trillion to its economy last year, growing at a rate three times that of the overall economy.</p>

<p>China’s efforts are challenging the assumption that emerging economies must choose between growth and sustainability. However, the pace of global fossil fuel use peaking depends on China’s own transition speed.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-brutal-diplomacy-how-it-pushed-potential-allies-into-chinas-camp">Trump’s Brutal Diplomacy: How It Pushed Potential Allies into China’s Camp</h2>

<p>Trump’s blunt-force diplomacy and punishing tariffs have led to unintended consequences, pushing potential allies like India and Russia closer to China. Trump’s actions, such as claiming to have solved the India-Pakistan conflict and imposing heavy tariffs on India, have strained relations with New Delhi. This shift is part of a broader geopolitical realignment where countries like Egypt, Turkey, and Vietnam, which have been hit by Trump’s tariffs, are also moving closer to China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting highlighted this trend, with leaders from these countries, including India’s Modi, engaging closely with China and Russia. Trump’s approach has accelerated this aggregation of aggrieved states, prompting warnings from former Biden officials about the potential loss of the innovation edge to China. Despite Trump’s attempts to downplay the rift with India, the relationship remains fragile, with India seeking alternatives to its dependence on the U.S.</p>
