  <p>Riku Kawasaki, known by his online handle <strong>maroonrk</strong>, is a highly accomplished competitive programmer from Japan, widely recognized for his exceptional achievements in the global competitive programming community. Born around 2001, Kawasaki has established himself as one of the top competitive programmers in the world, consistently ranking among the elite on platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and CodeChef. His journey in competitive programming, which began in 2016, showcases a remarkable ascent to the pinnacle of the field in just a few years, driven by his talent, dedication, and strategic approach to problem-solving. Beyond his competitive success, Kawasaki is also a significant contributor to the programming community as a problem setter, contest coordinator, and researcher.</p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h3>
<p>Riku Kawasaki is a student at the prestigious <strong>University of Tokyo</strong>, where he pursues his academic interests alongside his competitive programming career. His engagement with programming started at a young age, with a specific goal of competing in the <strong>International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</strong>. This ambition fueled his rapid development in the field, leading him to master complex algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques by his late teens. His academic background at the University of Tokyo likely complements his programming prowess, providing a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-programming-achievements">Competitive Programming Achievements</h3>

His work with AtCoder highlights his dual role as a competitor and a contributor to the programming community.<a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Topcoder</strong>: Under the handle <strong>maroon_kuri</strong>, Kawasaki was an <strong>Algorithmic Finalist</strong> at the <strong>Topcoder Open 2019</strong>, showcasing his versatility across different competitive programming platforms.<a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/riku-kawasaki/"></a><a href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:maroon_kuri"></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</strong>: Kawasaki is an <strong>IOI gold medalist</strong>, a testament to his early talent and preparation for high-stakes international competitions. His participation in IOI was a key motivator for his entry into competitive programming, and his success there solidified his reputation as part of Japan’s “golden IOI generation.”<a href="https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/5940"></a><a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)</strong>: Kawasaki also earned a <strong>gold medal</strong> at the ICPC World Finals, further demonstrating his ability to excel in team-based competitive programming environments.<a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CodeChef</strong>: On CodeChef, Kawasaki holds a global rank of 2 with a rating of 3304 (as of 2024), reinforcing his status as a top-tier programmer.<a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/maroonrk"></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributions-to-competitive-programming">Contributions to Competitive Programming</h3>
<p>Beyond his competitive achievements, Kawasaki is a prominent figure in the design and organization of programming contests. He is actively involved with <strong>AtCoder</strong>, where he writes and coordinates problems for some of the most challenging and prestigious contests, such as the <strong>AtCoder Grand Contests</strong> and <strong>World Tour Finals</strong>. His criteria for creating “great problems” emphasize creativity, technical depth, and elegance, earning him respect as a problem setter who pushes the boundaries of competitive programming.<a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFK9gqur93Y"></a></p>

<p>Kawasaki also contributes to the academic and competitive programming community through his involvement in initiatives like the <strong>ICPC CLI Symposium</strong>, where he serves as a co-chair for the Library Track, alongside other notable figures like Gennady Korotkevich. This role underscores his commitment to advancing the field through education and resource development.<a href="https://symposium.cli.u.icpc.global/biographies/"></a></p>

<h3 id="programming-style-and-philosophy">Programming Style and Philosophy</h3>
<p>Kawasaki’s approach to competitive programming is characterized by his strategic problem-solving and ability to adapt to diverse challenges. In a 2025 podcast interview, he discussed his philosophy of crafting problems that are both intellectually stimulating and aesthetically pleasing, reflecting his deep understanding of algorithmic design. His competitive success is attributed to his persistence, as evidenced by his multiple near-wins on Codeforces before securing a victory, and his ability to learn from each experience.<a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFK9gqur93Y"></a></p>

<p>Despite his intense focus on programming, Kawasaki maintains a balanced perspective, having initially entered the field with the goal of competing in IOI rather than aiming for global dominance. His humility is evident in his interactions, as seen in his engagement with the programming community through blog posts (125 entries on Codeforces) and his role as a mentor and collaborator.<a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/maroonrk"></a></p>

<h3 id="personal-life-and-interests">Personal Life and Interests</h3>
<p>Little is publicly known about Kawasaki’s personal life, as he maintains a low profile outside his professional and competitive endeavors. However, his curiosity and passion for problem-solving extend beyond programming. His work in design (noted in some sources) suggests an interest in creative fields, though this may refer to a different individual with the same name. In his 2019 IOI participation, Kawasaki mentioned that competitive programming was a means to achieve his IOI aspirations, indicating a goal-driven mindset.<a href="https://theorg.com/org/takram/org-chart/riku-kawasaki"></a><a href="https://www.takram.com/people/riku-kawasaki"></a><a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/riku-kawasaki/"></a></p>

<h3 id="legacy-and-impact">Legacy and Impact</h3>
<p>At just 20 years old in 2021, Riku Kawasaki had already achieved what many programmers aspire to over a lifetime. His rapid rise from a beginner in 2016 to a world-ranked competitor by 2021, coupled with his contributions as a problem setter and contest organizer, positions him as a pivotal figure in competitive programming. His rivalry with Gennady Korotkevich, the world’s top competitive programmer, has been a highlight of the field, pushing both to new heights.<a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/riku-kawasaki/"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich"></a></p>

<p>Kawasaki’s work with AtCoder and the ICPC Symposium ensures that his influence extends beyond his personal achievements, shaping the future of competitive programming through innovative problem design and community engagement. As a student at the University of Tokyo, he is also poised to make further contributions to computer science, potentially in research or industry, though his career plans remain open-ended.<a href="https://symposium.cli.u.icpc.global/biographies/"></a><a href="https://codeforces.com/topic/140421/en1"></a></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Riku Kawasaki is a prodigy in competitive programming, whose meteoric rise, technical brilliance, and community contributions have cemented his status as one of the world’s best.
