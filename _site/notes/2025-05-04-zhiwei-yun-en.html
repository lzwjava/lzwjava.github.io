  <p>Zhiwei Yun (Chinese: 恽之玮; pinyin: Yùn Zhīwěi), born in September 1982 in Changzhou, China, is a distinguished Chinese-American mathematician and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Renowned for his groundbreaking contributions to number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, Yun’s work primarily focuses on the Langlands program, a vast and influential framework aiming to unify disparate areas of mathematics, such as number theory and geometry. His research has earned him international acclaim, numerous prestigious awards, and a reputation as one of the leading mathematicians of his generation. Below is a comprehensive introduction to Yun’s life, education, career, mathematical contributions, and accolades, written with clarity for a broad audience while including technical details for those familiar with mathematics.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h3>
<p>Yun’s passion for mathematics emerged early in his childhood in Changzhou, a city in Jiangsu Province, China. He recalls his fascination beginning around third grade, when his mathematics teacher assigned daily thinking problems that sparked his curiosity. He likened learning mathematics to “digging a treasure underground, endless and boundless,” contrasting it with the finite challenge of climbing a mountain. This metaphor reflects his lifelong view of mathematics as an infinite, exploratory pursuit driven by curiosity and beauty.</p>

<p>Yun’s talent was evident in his school years. He attended elementary school at Bureau Elementary School and later studied at a provincial high school in Changzhou. In 2000, as a high school sophomore, he was selected for China’s National Training Team for the 41st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) held in Daejeon, South Korea. There, he won a gold medal with a perfect score, a rare achievement that marked him as an exceptional mathematical prodigy.</p>

<p>Yun pursued his undergraduate studies at Peking University, one of China’s top institutions, from 2000 to 2004, earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. During his senior year, he was drawn to algebraic geometry, captivated by its intricate theoretical framework, which he described as an exquisite building constructed by prior mathematicians. After graduating, Yun moved to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. at Princeton University, where he studied under the guidance of Robert MacPherson, a prominent mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study. His doctoral work, completed in 2009, focused on global Springer theory, a topic that would become a cornerstone of his contributions to the Langlands program.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="academic-career">Academic Career</h3>
<p>Yun’s academic career has been marked by rapid advancement and prestigious appointments at top institutions. After earning his Ph.D., he served as a C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT from 2010 to 2012, a highly competitive postdoctoral position. During this time, he began developing his theory of rigid automorphic forms, which addressed significant open problems in number theory.</p>

<p>From 2012 to 2016, Yun held positions at Stanford University, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor. In 2016, he joined Yale University as a full professor, a testament to his rising stature in the mathematical community. In January 2018, Yun returned to MIT as a professor of mathematics, where he continues to conduct research, mentor students, and collaborate with colleagues. His wife, Minlan Yu, whom he met at Princeton, is a professor of computer science at Harvard University, and together they have navigated the challenges of academic careers and family life, including a period of long-distance commuting between Stanford and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Yun’s approach to mentoring is notable for its emphasis on fostering independence. He encourages graduate students to pursue problems that align with their interests, believing this autonomy smooths the transition from student to researcher. His collaborative spirit is evident in his fruitful partnerships with mathematicians like Wei Zhang, with whom he has co-authored several influential papers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="mathematical-contributions">Mathematical Contributions</h3>
<p>Yun’s research lies at the intersection of representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry, with a particular focus on the Langlands program. The Langlands program, proposed by Robert Langlands in the 1960s, is a series of conjectures and frameworks that seek to connect number theory (the study of numbers and their properties) with geometry and representation theory (the study of symmetries and algebraic structures). It is considered one of the most ambitious and profound projects in modern mathematics, often compared to a “grand unified theory” for the field.</p>

<p>Below are some of Yun’s key contributions, explained for both general and technical audiences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Global Springer Theory and the Langlands Program</strong><br />
Yun’s Ph.D. thesis introduced global Springer theory, a generalization of Springer theory, which studies the action of Weyl groups on the cohomology of Springer fibers (subvarieties of flag manifolds). Yun extended this to Hitchin fibers, inspired by prior work by Gérard Laumon and Fields Medalist Bao-Châu Ngô. His global Springer theory provides a geometric framework for understanding affine Weyl group actions on cohomology, opening new avenues in the Langlands program. This work has been described as “opening whole new vistas” in the field.<br />
<em>Technical Impact</em>: Yun’s 2011 paper in <em>Advances in Mathematics</em> (“Global Springer Theory”) and 2012 paper in <em>Compositio Mathematica</em> (“Langlands Duality and Global Springer Theory”) formalized these ideas, providing tools to study automorphic forms and their geometric interpretations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rigid Automorphic Forms and the Inverse Galois Problem</strong><br />
During his time as a Moore Instructor at MIT, Yun developed the theory of rigid automorphic forms, which he used to address an open question posed by Jean-Pierre Serre on motives (algebraic structures that capture geometric and arithmetic properties). This work led to a major breakthrough on the inverse Galois problem, a classical question in number theory about realizing Galois groups as symmetries of algebraic equations.<br />
<em>Technical Impact</em>: His 2014 paper in <em>Inventiones Mathematicae</em> (“Motives with Exceptional Galois Groups and the Inverse Galois Problem”) provided a uniform construction of motives with exceptional Galois groups, a problem sought by Serre and Grothendieck for over 40 years. This is considered one of the most significant advances in motive theory in recent decades.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geometric Interpretations of L-Functions</strong><br />
In collaboration with Wei Zhang, Yun has made significant contributions to the arithmetic of L-functions, which are complex functions central to number theory and the Langlands program. Their joint work provides geometric interpretations of higher derivatives of automorphic L-functions in terms of intersection numbers, offering new insights into conjectures like the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the Clay Mathematics Institute’s Millennium Prize Problems.<br />
<em>Technical Impact</em>: Their 2017 paper and subsequent work, recognized by the 2018 New Horizons Breakthrough Prize, advanced the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture, connecting L-functions to geometric structures in function fields.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborative Work and Interdisciplinary Connections</strong><br />
Yun has co-authored influential papers with mathematicians like Davesh Maulik (<em>Macdonald Formula for Curves with Planar Singularities</em>, 2014) and Roman Bezrukavnikov (<em>On Koszul Duality for Kac-Moody Groups</em>, 2013). His work often bridges algebraic geometry and representation theory, as seen in his 2016 paper with Alexei Oblomkov on geometric representations of Cherednik algebras. These collaborations highlight his ability to connect seemingly disparate mathematical fields, a hallmark of his approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recent Work on Shtukas and Moduli Spaces</strong><br />
Yun’s recent research explores Drinfeld shtukas and their moduli stacks, which are geometric objects used to study function fields in the Langlands program. His 2022 YouTube lecture series on shtukas outlines their geometric and cohomological properties, contributing to the Kudla program and higher theta series for unitary groups.<br />
<em>Technical Impact</em>: Papers like “Higher Siegel–Weil Formula for Unitary Groups” (with Wei Zhang) and “Geometric Langlands for Hypergeometric Sheaves” (with Konstantin Jakob) demonstrate his ongoing work on derived algebraic geometry and endoscopy in Hecke categories.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Yun’s publications, which number over 39 with more than 1,161 citations, reflect his prolific output and influence. His work is characterized by a blend of deep geometric intuition and rigorous number-theoretic insight, often leveraging tools from cohomology, motives, and derived algebraic geometry to tackle long-standing problems.</p>
