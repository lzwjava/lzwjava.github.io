    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quote</strong>: “When something’s not done right, my instinct isn’t to fix it anymore. I think: How can I help this person learn? We’re building a team to do great things for the next decade, not just the next year.”</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quote</strong>: “Consultants don’t take ownership of the product and their experience with the products in general are extremely limited—they’re two-dimensional slices of three dimensional objects.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Implication</strong>: He advocates for in-house expertise and hands-on involvement in product development.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-vision-for-technology-and-innovation">6. <strong>Vision for Technology and Innovation</strong></h4>

  <li><strong>Challenging the Status Quo</strong>: He encourages the audience to question conventional wisdom and take risks, drawing from his own experience of dropping out of college to pursue his passions.</li>

  <li><strong>People Over Process</strong>: Building a strong, motivated team is more important than rigid systems or external consultants.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Excellence</strong>: Obsession with creating superior products drives innovation and long-term success.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-Term Vision</strong>: Leadership requires patience, mentorship, and a focus on decade-long goals, not quick fixes.</li>
