  <hr>

  <p>I’m sorry to hear about your experience—losing a million yuan on a house purchase is a tough blow, especially when it stems from a mix of personal choices and larger forces beyond your control. It’s brave of you to reflect so openly, and it’s clear you’ve already identified some key personal drivers like vanity, conformity, and family pressures. I’ll build on that to explore deeper reasons why this suffering happened, drawing from psychological, social, economic, and even philosophical angles. I’ll aim to make this insightful rather than judgmental, as these patterns are common in high-stakes environments like China’s real estate market. Think of this as layers of an onion: your individual story is intertwined with broader human and systemic dynamics.</p>

<h3 id="1-psychological-traps-the-illusion-of-control-and-short-term-emotional-wins">1. <strong>Psychological Traps: The Illusion of Control and Short-Term Emotional Wins</strong></h3>
<p>At a deeper level, much of your suffering stems from universal cognitive biases that make rational foresight feel irrelevant in the moment. You mentioned reading He Qinglian’s book in 2019 and recognizing the unsustainability of the real estate economy—yet you still bought in 2022. This isn’t just “vanity” or care for others’ opinions; it’s the pull of <strong>loss aversion</strong> and <strong>present bias</strong>, where the immediate emotional payoff (e.g., the pride of owning a home, escaping family friction for “independent space”) outweighs long-term risks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why this happens</strong>: Humans are wired to prioritize avoiding immediate pain (like parental arguments or social comparison) over abstract future threats (a market crash). In 2022, China’s property market was still riding post-pandemic stimulus highs, with prices seeming “sticky” upward. Your limited international perspective from the Southeast Asian bank stint played into this—you hadn’t yet internalized global examples of bubbles bursting (e.g., 2008 U.S. subprime crisis or Japan’s 1990s real estate slump). Envy and FOMO (fear of missing out) amplify this: seeing others “win” easy gains creates a sunk-cost fallacy in reverse, pushing you to join the herd before it’s “too late.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deeper suffering link</strong>: The house stood empty after just a year because the emotional high of independence faded quickly, replaced by the reality of family needs (child-rearing). This creates a cycle of regret: you’ve not only lost money but also time and mental energy chasing an illusion of autonomy that didn’t deliver lasting fulfillment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-societal-and-cultural-pressures-the-weight-of-collectivism-vs-individualism">2. <strong>Societal and Cultural Pressures: The Weight of Collectivism vs. Individualism</strong></h3>
<p>China’s cultural fabric adds another layer—property ownership isn’t just financial; it’s a proxy for success, stability, and social validation. You quit WeChat Moments to escape this, which is wise, but the deeper reason you bought was entanglement in a system that equates worth with assets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conformity and status signaling</strong>: In Confucian-influenced societies like China, “face” (mianzi) and comparison with peers (e.g., “others are buying and getting rich”) create immense pressure. Your mention of selfishness and envy in the broader population mirrors this: the housing boom was fueled by a national narrative of “easy money” through investment, contrasting the “hard work” of STEM or IT pursuits you prefer. But for many, including you at the time, buying a house was a way to signal adulthood, security, and escape the stigma of living with parents—especially in a city like Guangzhou, where urban density and family norms collide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Family dynamics as a catalyst</strong>: Living with parents sparked “ideological friction,” but this is deeper than mere annoyance. In intergenerational Chinese households, there’s often an unspoken expectation to “settle down” via property, clashing with younger generations’ desires for personal growth (like your IT interests). Your child’s upbringing forced a return to the family home, highlighting how these decisions ripple into relational suffering—independence bought at a cost that ultimately reinforced dependence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why the bubble burst amplified your pain</strong>: From 2023–2025, the drop was swift because the system encouraged over-leveraging (e.g., developer debt, local government reliance on land sales). When Evergrande and others collapsed, it exposed the fragility, turning individual envy into collective loss. Your timing—buying near the peak—was unlucky, but it’s a symptom of how societal hype overrides personal wisdom.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-economic-and-systemic-forces-the-inevitability-of-bubbles-in-unbalanced-growth">3. <strong>Economic and Systemic Forces: The Inevitability of Bubbles in Unbalanced Growth</strong></h3>
<p>On a macro level, your story is a microcosm of China’s “real estate addiction.” He Qinglian’s book nailed it: the economy’s over-reliance on property (up to 30% of GDP pre-2023) created a Ponzi-like scheme where prices rose on speculation, not fundamentals. People like you, hoping for “easy gains,” were participants, but the suffering is rooted in structural flaws.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Policy-driven illusions</strong>: Government interventions (e.g., low interest rates, hukou-linked buying incentives in cities like Guangzhou) made investment seem low-risk. Your overseas assignment gave a brief “international” lens, but without deeper exposure, it couldn’t counter the domestic echo chamber of rising prices. The 2023 crackdown on developers and shadow banking was necessary but brutal, catching late buyers like you in the downdraft.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Global context</strong>: China’s bubble echoes historical patterns—speculative manias followed by corrections—exacerbated by demographics (aging population reducing demand) and post-COVID economic slowdown. Your loss of 1 million yuan (roughly 20-30% drop?) is painful, but it’s part of a national reckoning: trillions in household wealth wiped out, forcing a shift toward productive sectors like tech that you value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Philosophical undertone</strong>: Why do “all things happen”? This ties to impermanence (a concept in both Eastern philosophy and your reflective mindset). Bubbles form because humans chase eternal growth in an impermanent world; suffering arises when we attach identity to fleeting assets. Your vanity and conformity were entry points, but the real “why” is the illusion that material gains can satisfy deeper needs like autonomy or purpose.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reflections-and-paths-forward">Reflections and Paths Forward</h3>
<p>Your suffering isn’t just bad luck—it’s a painful teacher, revealing how personal flaws (biases, emotions) interact with societal traps (status games, herd behavior) and systemic risks (bubble economics). But recognizing this, as you are, is the first step to freedom. You’ve already taken smart moves: ditching WeChat Moments, focusing on blogging/niche sharing, and prioritizing family for your child. Lean into your IT interests—they offer real, sustainable value without the envy cycle.</p>

<p>If you’re open, consider practical steps: Consult a financial advisor for options like renting out the Guangzhou house (via platforms like Ziroom, if feasible) to offset losses, or explore government subsidies for empty properties. Therapy or journaling could unpack the vanity/conformity residue. Ultimately, this chapter might redirect you toward a life of genuine alignment—hard like STEM, but rewarding.</p>

<p>If you’d like to dive deeper into any part (e.g., specific biases or economic data), just say the word. You’re not alone in this.</p>
