  <p>Charles Ingerham “Chuck” Peddle (November 25, 1937 – December 15, 2019) was an American electrical engineer and technology pioneer whose visionary work in the 1970s and 1980s laid the foundation for the personal computer revolution. Best known for designing the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, a low-cost, high-performance chip that powered iconic systems like the Commodore PET, Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 2600, and Nintendo Entertainment System, Peddle’s contributions reshaped the computing landscape. His innovative approach to affordable microprocessors made computing accessible to consumers, hobbyists, and industries, earning him recognition as a foundational figure in the personal computer industry.</p>

<p>Born in Bangor, Maine, to British-Canadian immigrant parents, Peddle grew up in a working-class family in Augusta. His early life was marked by modest means, and he initially had no plans for higher education. After graduating from Cony High School in 1955, he briefly worked manual labor jobs before joining the United States Marine Corps. This experience, coupled with encouragement from his mother, led him to pursue a Bachelor of Science in engineering physics at the University of Maine, graduating in 1959 or 1960 (sources vary). During his time at the university, he developed a passion for information theory and binary arithmetic, which would shape his future career.</p>

<p>Peddle’s professional journey began at General Electric in 1961, where he worked on time-sharing systems for mainframe computers and developed electronic cash registers. His early exposure to computing sparked a belief in distributed intelligence over centralized systems, a vision that guided his later work. In 1970, after GE scaled back its computer division, Peddle and colleagues used severance funds to start Intelligent Terminal Systems, aiming to design point-of-sale systems. Though the venture struggled due to funding issues, it honed his entrepreneurial instincts.</p>

<p>In 1973, Peddle joined Motorola to work on the 6800 microprocessor, one of the earliest microprocessors. Frustrated by its high cost ($200–$300, equivalent to ~$900–$1,350 in 2018), which limited its market potential, he championed a more affordable alternative. When Motorola dismissed his vision, Peddle and several colleagues left in 1974 to join MOS Technology. There, he led the development of the 6502 microprocessor, introduced in 1975 at a groundbreaking price of $25. This chip, along with its predecessor, the 6501, offered performance comparable to competitors like the Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 but at a fraction of the cost, making it a game-changer for consumer electronics and personal computing.</p>

<p>At MOS Technology, Peddle also designed the KIM-1, a single-board computer for developers, and later, after MOS was acquired by Commodore in 1976, he spearheaded the creation of the Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor), one of the first consumer-ready personal computers, launched in 1977. The PET, alongside contemporaries like the Apple II (which also used the 6502), marked the dawn of the personal computer era. Peddle’s work extended to other Commodore systems, including the VIC-20 and contributions to the Commodore 64, both of which became massively successful.</p>

<p>In 1980, Peddle left Commodore with financier Chris Fish to found Sirius Systems Technology, where he designed the Victor 9000, a 16-bit personal computer. Despite its advanced features, the Victor 9000 struggled against the IBM PC’s dominance and software incompatibility, leading to Sirius’s bankruptcy in 1984. Peddle later joined Tandon Corporation in 1985, where he developed the Tandon PAC 286 with a swappable hard drive and served as president until the company’s collapse in 1993. He then worked as chief technology officer at Celetron, a hard drive manufacturer, until his retirement.</p>

<p>Peddle’s legacy is profound. The 6502 microprocessor powered a generation of devices, from computers to gaming consoles, and its affordability democratized technology. Industry peers, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, lauded his contributions, with technology journalist Phil Lemmons declaring in 1982 that “more than any other person, Chuck Peddle deserves to be called the founder of the personal computer industry.” Peddle received accolades such as the University of Maine’s 2019 Alumni Career Achievement Award and the Edward T. Bryand Distinguished Engineering Award.</p>

<p>A contrarian and visionary, Peddle’s personal life reflected his adventurous spirit. Married twice, he had three sons and three daughters. After retiring, he traveled extensively, spending time in Nevada, Sri Lanka, and India. He passed away on December 15, 2019, in Santa Cruz, California, from pancreatic cancer, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence modern computing. His work not only sparked a technological revolution but also inspired generations of engineers and hobbyists who maligng:0⁊<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Peddle"></a><a href="https://www.commodore.ca/commodore-history/the-legendary-chuck-peddle-inventor-of-the-personal-computer/"></a><a href="https://ethw.org/Chuck_Peddle"></a></p>
