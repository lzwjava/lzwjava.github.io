  <p>It’s impossible to definitively say who the “greatest” scientists of all time are, as different people value different contributions and fields of study. However, some scientists consistently appear on lists of the most influential and impactful figures in history due to their groundbreaking discoveries and the profound way they changed our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>Here are a few scientists who are widely considered among the greatest, along with some of their key achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727):</strong> A towering figure in the scientific revolution.
    <ul>
      <li>Formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, explaining how objects move on Earth and in the cosmos. For example, his law of universal gravitation explained why planets orbit the sun.</li>
      <li>Developed calculus independently of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a mathematical tool essential for much of modern science and engineering.</li>
      <li>Made significant contributions to optics, including discovering that white light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow and building the first reflecting telescope.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Developed the theory of relativity (both special and general), which has had a profound impact on physics and cosmology. The special theory introduced the famous equation $\(E=mc^2\)$, demonstrating the equivalence of mass and energy. The general theory described gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.</li>
      <li>Explained the photoelectric effect, a crucial step in the development of quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
      <li>His work laid the foundation for many technologies, including nuclear energy and the laser.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642):</strong> Played a crucial role in the transition from natural philosophy to modern science.
    <ul>
      <li>Made significant improvements to the telescope and used it to observe the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter, and sunspots, providing strong evidence for the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system.</li>
      <li>Formulated laws of motion for falling objects and laid the groundwork for Newton’s laws.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Marie Curie (1867-1934):</strong> A pioneer in radioactivity research.
    <ul>
      <li>Was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry).</li>
      <li>Discovered the elements polonium and radium and conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Her work has been crucial in developing cancer treatments and nuclear medicine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Charles Darwin (1809-1882):</strong> Developed the theory of evolution by natural selection.
    <ul>
      <li>His book “On the Origin of Species” revolutionized biology and our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. His theory explains how species change over time and adapt to their environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nikola Tesla (1856-1943):</strong> A visionary inventor and engineer.
    <ul>
      <li>Made significant contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical system, which is used worldwide.</li>
