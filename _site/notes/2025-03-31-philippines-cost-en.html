  <p>As of 2022, the revenue of the City of Manila, the capital of the Philippines, was <strong>₱ 19,692 million</strong>. Using an approximate exchange rate of 1 USD ≈ 55 PHP (as of March 31, 2025), this is roughly equivalent to <strong>$358 million USD</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s a more detailed look at the economic aspects of Manila:</p>

<p><strong>Key Economic Features of Manila:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Major Hub:</strong> Manila has been the principal city of the Philippines for four centuries and remains the center of the country’s economic, political, social, and cultural activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Service-Oriented Economy:</strong> The economy of the Philippines, and particularly Metro Manila, is largely service-oriented. In 2023, the services sector contributed 62.3% to the national GDP. This sector includes trade, finance, transportation, communication, and tourism.</li>
  <li><strong>Trade and Commerce:</strong> Manila is a significant center for trade and finance in the Philippines. Most of the country’s imports and exports pass through the Port of Manila. The districts north of the Pasig River are key areas for trade and commerce.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> While services dominate, Manila also has diverse manufacturing activities, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Textile production</li>
      <li>Publishing and printing</li>
      <li>Food and tobacco processing</li>
      <li>Chemical processing</li>
      <li>Production of lumber and wood items, rope, soap, and other goods.</li>
      <li>Electronics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Many major financial institutions are headquartered in Manila, including the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Philippine National Bank, and numerous private commercial and development banks. The Philippine Stock Exchange is also located here.</li>
  <li><strong>Global City Status:</strong> Manila is considered part of the world’s original set of global cities due to its historical commercial networks. In 2018, it was listed as an “Alpha-“ global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, ranking seventh in economic performance globally and second regionally.</li>
  <li><strong>Contribution to National Economy:</strong> Metro Manila’s GDP equates to a significant portion of the Philippine GDP.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO):</strong> The BPO sector has seen substantial growth in Metro Manila, taking advantage of the local workforce.</li>
  <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Tourism is an important contributor to Manila’s economy, with the Philippines achieving record-high tourism revenue in 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The revenue figure provided is specifically for the <strong>City of Manila</strong>. Metro Manila encompasses a much larger area with multiple cities and municipalities, and its total economic output and revenue would be significantly higher.</li>
  <li>Economic data can have a time lag, so the 2022 figure is the most recent specific revenue for the City of Manila found in the search results.</li>
  <li>The Philippine economy is classified as a developing/emerging, lower-middle-income, and newly industrialized country.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, Manila serves as the economic heart of the Philippines, with a strong emphasis on services, trade, finance, and a notable manufacturing sector. The city generates substantial revenue and plays a crucial role in the national economy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Based on the search results, here’s an overview of the average earnings for people in the Philippines and IT workers:</p>

<p><strong>1. Average Income:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Average Monthly Salary:</strong> Estimates for the average monthly salary in the Philippines for 2025 range from <strong>₱25,000 to ₱30,000</strong>, which is approximately <strong>$455 to $545 USD</strong> (using an exchange rate of 1 USD ≈ 55 PHP).</li>
  <li>Other sources provide slightly different figures. A 2022 survey by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) placed the average monthly wage at <strong>₱18,423</strong> (around <strong>$335 USD</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Average Annual Salary:</strong> For 2025, the average annual salary is estimated to be around <strong>₱539,755.48</strong> (approximately <strong>$9,814 USD</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Median Monthly Salary:</strong> The median monthly salary in 2022 was <strong>₱18,423</strong> (around <strong>$335 USD</strong>), projected to reach approximately <strong>₱20,583</strong> (around <strong>$374 USD</strong>) in 2024 with an estimated annual growth. The median represents the middle value, meaning half of the employees earn less and half earn more than this amount.</li>
  <li><strong>Average Annual Family Income:</strong> In 2023, the average annual family income was estimated at <strong>₱353,230</strong> (approximately <strong>$6,422 USD</strong>). This figure can vary significantly by region, with the National Capital Region (NCR) having the highest average family income.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum Wage:</strong> The daily minimum wage varies significantly by region. In the National Capital Region (NCR), it’s around <strong>₱610 to ₱645 per day</strong> (approximately <strong>$11.09 to $11.73 USD</strong>). Provincial areas have lower rates.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Income of IT Workers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>IT workers generally earn above the national average due to the demand for their skills.</li>
  <li><strong>General IT Roles:</strong> The average monthly salary for Information Technology Officer jobs ranges from <strong>₱27,000 to ₱37,000</strong> (approximately <strong>$491 to $673 USD</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Software Engineers:</strong> The average annual salary for a Software Engineer can range significantly, with an average around <strong>₱467,503</strong> (approximately <strong>$8,500 USD</strong>). Entry-level positions will be lower, while senior roles can be much higher, potentially exceeding <strong>₱936,000</strong> (approximately <strong>$17,018 USD</strong>) annually. Some foreign companies might offer even higher salaries.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Developers:</strong> Average annual salaries can be around <strong>₱289,655</strong> (approximately <strong>$5,266 USD</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>IT Project Managers:</strong> Average annual salaries can range significantly, potentially around <strong>₱972,315</strong> (approximately <strong>$17,678 USD</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Other IT Roles:</strong> Salaries vary for roles like Data Scientists, Cybersecurity Analysts, and Network Administrators, often reflecting the demand and specialization required. For instance, Cloud Solutions Architects and Machine Learning Engineers can command higher salaries.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Salaries are generally higher in Metro Manila and other major urban centers like Cebu and Davao compared to rural areas. The average salary in Metro Manila is often 30-50% higher than in provincial areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Experience Level:</strong> Entry-level positions naturally have lower salaries compared to mid-level and senior roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Industry and Company Size:</strong> Multinational companies and those in higher-growth sectors may offer more competitive salaries.</li>
  <li><strong>Skills and Specialization:</strong> Specific in-demand skills within the IT sector (e.g., cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity) can lead to higher earning potential.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, while the average income in the Philippines is relatively modest, IT professionals, particularly those with specialized skills and experience in major cities, generally earn significantly more. However, there’s a considerable range depending on the specific role, company, and location.</p>

<hr />

</ul>

<p>In summary, while the Philippines offers a relatively affordable cost of living compared to many other countries, Manila can be more expensive than other regions within the country. Your individual lifestyle and location within Manila will ultimately determine your monthly expenses.</p>
