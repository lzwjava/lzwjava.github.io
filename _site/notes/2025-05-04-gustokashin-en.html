<p>Gustokashin teaches several courses at HSE University, focusing on foundational and advanced topics in computer science. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong> (Bachelor’s program, Faculty of Computer Science, 1st year, 2nd and 4th modules)</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures 2</strong> (Bachelor’s program, Faculty of Computer Science, 2nd year, 1st module)</li>
</ul>

<p>These courses are part of the curriculum for students in the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program, equipping them with critical skills in algorithm design, optimization, and data structure implementation. His teaching is tailored to both theoretical understanding and practical application, aligning with the demands of competitive programming.</p>

<h3 id="contributions-to-competitive-programming">Contributions to Competitive Programming</h3>
<p>Mikhail Gustokashin is a key figure in Russia’s competitive programming community, known for his success in preparing students and schoolchildren for prestigious contests. His contributions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC):</strong> Gustokashin himself has competed successfully in the ICPC, notably winning a prize in the ICPC Challenge, an individual optimization problem-solving competition distinct from the traditional team-based ICPC format. In this event, held at the end of August (year not specified in the source), he demonstrated his ability to tackle complex, industry-relevant optimization problems. Additionally, he has mentored HSE University students who have excelled in ICPC, including teams that advanced to semi-finals and won regional contests.</li>
  <li><strong>Moscow Olympiad for Schoolchildren in Informatics:</strong> As the head of the methodological committee for this Olympiad, Gustokashin plays a pivotal role in designing tasks and evaluating participants. His work ensures that the competition maintains a high standard of rigor and fairness, helping identify and nurture young talent in informatics.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Competitions:</strong> He serves on the jury of numerous programming competitions and has prepared dozens of winners and prize-winners for the All-Russian Olympiads, a testament to his effectiveness as a mentor and educator.</li>
</ul>
