  <p>As of June 7, 2025, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers are currently facing each other in the NBA Finals. Here are the significant players for each team:</p>

<p><strong>Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA):</strong> He is the clear leader and arguably the most significant player for the Thunder, having won the NBA MVP award for the 2024-2025 season. He’s a prolific scorer and playmaker who drives their offense.</li>
  <li><strong>Chet Holmgren:</strong> The young big man is a crucial piece on both ends of the floor, providing rim protection, shooting, and offensive versatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Jalen Williams:</strong> A rising star, Williams is a strong two-way player who contributes significantly in scoring, playmaking, and defense.</li>
  <li><strong>Luguentz Dort:</strong> Known for his tenacious defense, Dort often takes on the toughest perimeter assignments and can also hit timely shots.</li>
  <li><strong>Alex Caruso:</strong> A recent addition, Caruso brings veteran leadership and elite perimeter defense to the Thunder.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Indiana Pacers (IND)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tyrese Haliburton:</strong> He is the engine of the Pacers’ fast-paced offense. Haliburton is an elite passer, scorer, and decision-maker who elevates his teammates’ play.</li>
  <li><strong>Pascal Siakam:</strong> Acquired to provide championship experience and a versatile offensive and defensive presence, Siakam has been a pivotal player for the Pacers.</li>
  <li><strong>Myles Turner:</strong> As the Pacers’ primary rim protector and a strong three-point shooter for a big man, Turner’s defense in the paint and ability to stretch the floor are vital.</li>
  <li><strong>Andrew Nembhard:</strong> Nembhard has stepped up as a reliable guard, contributing with his defense, playmaking, and timely scoring.</li>
  <li><strong>Bennedict Mathurin:</strong> A young, explosive scorer, Mathurin provides instant offense and a strong athletic presence off the bench or in the starting lineup.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like you’re asking why the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder <em>did</em> make it to the 2025 NBA Finals! Based on the search results, it’s already happening. They are currently playing in the 2025 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of why these two teams are competing for the championship, according to the information provided:</p>

<p><strong>Oklahoma City Thunder (Western Conference Champions):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dominant Regular Season:</strong> They finished the regular season with an NBA-best 68-14 record.</li>
  <li><strong>MVP Performance by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA):</strong> SGA was named the 2025 MVP and has continued his dominant play in the playoffs, leading the league in scoring and showing remarkable consistency. He’s also the Western Conference Finals MVP.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong Defensive Team:</strong> The Thunder have a formidable defense, leading the playoffs in forced turnovers and steals, and holding opponents to a low field goal percentage. They are described as having “one of the best defenses in league history” with multiple versatile defenders.</li>
  <li><strong>Youthful Talent &amp; Depth:</strong> Beyond SGA, they have a strong core of young talent, including Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, who have stepped up throughout the playoffs. Their depth allows them to guard multiple positions and switch defensively.</li>
  <li><strong>Effective Transition Play:</strong> They thrive in transition, scoring at a high rate and forcing opponents into unfavorable positions.</li>
  <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> They navigated a tough Western Conference, including a seven-game series against the Denver Nuggets and a five-game win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Indiana Pacers (Eastern Conference Champions):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tyrese Haliburton’s Elite Playmaking:</strong> Haliburton has been exceptional, averaging a double-double in the playoffs (21 points, 10.5 assists) and orchestrating their high-octane offense. He was instrumental in their Game 1 Finals win.</li>
  <li><strong>High-Paced, Efficient Offense:</strong> The Pacers play at a breakneck pace, which often catches opponents off guard. They are highly efficient, ranking well in points per game and offensive rating, and are excellent at taking care of the ball (third fewest turnovers in the NBA).</li>
  <li><strong>Effective Shooting:</strong> They have shown strong shooting percentages, both overall and from three-point range.</li>
  <li><strong>Balanced Scoring &amp; Depth:</strong> All five starters scored in double-figures in Game 1 of the Finals, and they get significant contributions from their bench (like Obi Toppin’s 17 points in Game 1). Pascal Siakam was named Eastern Conference Finals MVP.</li>
  <li><strong>Underdog Mentality &amp; Resilience:</strong> The Pacers have made a habit of upsetting higher-seeded teams, knocking off the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks on their way to the Finals. They’ve also shown a remarkable ability to come back from deficits, as seen in their Game 1 Finals win against the Thunder.</li>
  <li><strong>Winning on the Road:</strong> They proved their mettle by winning crucial road games in previous series.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both teams entered the Finals with impressive 12-4 playoff records, showcasing their strength and readiness for the biggest stage. The matchup is seen as a fascinating clash of styles between the Thunder’s elite defense and SGA’s scoring, and the Pacers’ high-powered offense led by Haliburton’s playmaking.</p>
