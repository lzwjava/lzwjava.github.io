  <p>Rareș Darius Buhai is a highly accomplished Romanian computer scientist, competitive programmer, and researcher, widely recognized for his extraordinary achievements in international programming competitions and his contributions to theoretical computer science and machine learning. Born in Bistrița, Romania, Buhai rose to prominence through his exceptional performance at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), where he secured four consecutive gold medals from 2012 to 2015, a feat that placed him second in the IOI Hall of Fame, surpassed only by Belarusian programmer Gennady Korotkevich. His competitive programming career, combined with his academic pursuits at prestigious institutions like MIT and ETH Zurich, has established him as a leading figure in the global programming and research communities.</p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-introduction-to-programming">Early Life and Introduction to Programming</h3>
<p>Buhai’s passion for computer science was sparked at a young age, encouraged by his father, an engineer. By age nine, he was already creating programs in Visual Basic, and at 11, while in fifth grade, he participated in his first programming olympiad. Attending Colegiul Național “Liviu Rebreanu” in Bistrița, Buhai honed his skills in algorithms and problem-solving, laying the foundation for his competitive success. His early exposure to programming competitions and a supportive environment fueled his rapid development as a coder and mathematician.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-programming-career">Competitive Programming Career</h3>
<p>Buhai’s competitive programming career is marked by unparalleled success at the IOI, one of the most prestigious global competitions for high school students. Competing from 2012 to 2015, he won gold medals each year, a record unmatched by any other Romanian contestant and equaled only by Polish programmer Filip Wolski. His 2015 performance at the IOI in Almaty, Kazakhstan, solidified his place as the second-most decorated IOI participant in history, with a total of four golds. This achievement earned him widespread recognition, including praise from his professor Adrian Panaete, who noted that Buhai “wrote a new page in the history of Romanian informatics.”</p>

<p>Beyond the IOI, Buhai was active on platforms like Codeforces, where he achieved a grandmaster rating with a peak contest rating of 2499, reflecting his mastery of algorithmic problem-solving. His profile on Codeforces indicates he solved 478 problems over his career, showcasing his dedication to the craft. Buhai also participated in other competitions, such as those on Topcoder, further demonstrating his versatility and skill across different programming platforms.</p>

<h3 id="academic-journey-and-research-contributions">Academic Journey and Research Contributions</h3>
<p>After graduating high school, Buhai was accepted with scholarships to MIT, Stanford, and Harvard, ultimately choosing MIT for its strength in computer science. He earned a Master of Engineering (MEng) from MIT between 2019 and 2020, working under Professor Guy Bresler. During his time at MIT, Buhai conducted research in robotics, developing algorithms for dynamic environments, which resulted in two conference papers. He also interned at Facebook (now Meta) for four months, where he contributed to the development of the Messenger platform, leveraging his competitive programming skills to excel in technical interviews.</p>

<p>Since 2020, Buhai has been pursuing a PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Professor David Steurer. His research focuses on the theoretical aspects of computer science and machine learning, with an emphasis on algorithms, robust mixture learning, and computational-statistical gaps. His work has been published in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, FOCS, COLT, and STOC. Notable papers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“Robust Mixture Learning when Outliers Overwhelm Small Groups” (NeurIPS 2024)</strong>, co-authored with Daniil Dmitriev, Stefan Tiegel, and others, addressing challenges in learning from noisy data.</li>
  <li><strong>“Semirandom Planted Clique and the Restricted Isometry Property” (FOCS 2024)</strong>, with Jarosław Błasiok, Pravesh K. Kothari, and David Steurer, exploring graph algorithms and linear algebra.</li>
  <li><strong>“Beyond Parallel Pancakes: Quasi-Polynomial Time Guarantees for Non-Spherical Gaussian Mixtures” (COLT 2023)</strong>, co-authored with Steurer, advancing clustering algorithms for complex data distributions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Buhai’s Google Scholar profile lists 238 citations, reflecting the impact of his work in algorithms and machine learning. His research combines mathematical rigor with practical applications, addressing problems like overparameterization in supervised learning and efficient algorithms for restricted Boltzmann machines.</p>

<h3 id="personal-attributes-and-impact">Personal Attributes and Impact</h3>
<p>Described as a “genius” by Romanian media and educators, Buhai is not only a technical prodigy but also a creative thinker. He emphasized the importance of “creative coders” who can devise innovative solutions to complex problems, a philosophy that guided his success in competitions and research. Despite his international achievements, Buhai expressed a connection to his Romanian roots, dedicating a 2014 gold medal to his country on Romania’s Flag Day. His humility and patriotism resonated with his community, with local leaders like Radu Moldovan, president of Bistrița-Năsăud County, celebrating his role in putting Bistrița on the global stage.</p>

<p>Buhai’s financial independence during high school, supported by state scholarships for his olympiad successes, allowed him to invest in tools like laptops to further his studies. His decision to study abroad was driven by a desire to work with the world’s best researchers, but he has expressed hope of contributing to Romania in the future.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-and-current-work">Legacy and Current Work</h3>
<p>As of 2025, Buhai continues his PhD at ETH Zurich, pushing the boundaries of theoretical computer science. His competitive programming legacy remains a benchmark for aspiring programmers, particularly in Romania, where he inspired a generation of students through his IOI dominance. His transition from competitive programming to cutting-edge research demonstrates the versatility of skills developed through algorithmic competitions, such as problem-solving, optimization, and mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Buhai’s story is one of talent, perseverance, and global impact. From a small town in Romania to the halls of MIT and ETH Zurich, he has bridged competitive programming and academic research, leaving a lasting mark on both fields. His work continues to influence machine learning and algorithm design, while his competitive achievements remain a testament to his brilliance as a coder.</p>
