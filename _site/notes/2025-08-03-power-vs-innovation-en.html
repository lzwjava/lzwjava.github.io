  <p>Your question touches on an interesting contrast between the “spotlight” figures like political leaders (Trump, Xi, Putin) who dominate headlines with their pursuit of power, and the “background” contributors—like the engineers, developers, designers, and IT professionals who build and maintain the apps and services we rely on daily (eBay, Amazon, Walmart online, Instacart, Uber, Grab, and countless others). As a Chinese citizen, you mention using these infrequently, but they’re part of a global ecosystem that quietly shapes modern life. You’re essentially asking if these behind-the-scenes workers are inherently more honest and kind than the power-hungry elites.</p>

<p>Let me break this down thoughtfully. It’s not a black-and-white issue—human nature is complex—but there’s some merit to the idea that visibility and power can corrupt, while quieter roles might foster different virtues. I’ll explain my reasoning step by step.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-nature-of-visibility-and-power">1. <strong>The Nature of Visibility and Power</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>High-profile leaders like the ones you mentioned often thrive on ambition, strategy, and sometimes ruthlessness. History shows that seeking and holding power can lead to ethical compromises: think of how leaders might prioritize personal legacy, national interests, or alliances over transparency or kindness. News cycles amplify this—scandals, decisions, and rhetoric make them seem larger-than-life, but it doesn’t always reflect genuine character.</li>
  <li>In contrast, the “background” people (engineers, coders, data scientists, etc.) operate in relative anonymity. Their work is collaborative and problem-solving oriented: writing code for seamless shopping on Amazon, optimizing algorithms for Uber’s ride-matching, or ensuring Instacart’s delivery logistics run smoothly. These roles reward technical skill, innovation, and efficiency rather than public charisma or dominance. Without the temptations of fame or absolute authority, they might indeed appear (or be) more grounded and less prone to ego-driven flaws.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-are-engineers-and-it-workers-more-honest-and-kind">2. <strong>Are Engineers and IT Workers More Honest and Kind?</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Not universally, but often by circumstance</strong>: Many in tech are motivated by curiosity, a desire to improve lives, or intellectual challenge rather than power. For instance, open-source contributors (like those behind Linux or Python libraries that power many apps) often work for free, driven by community and altruism. Surveys of software engineers frequently highlight values like collaboration, ethical coding practices, and user empathy—qualities that align with “kindness.” In China, for example, engineers at companies like Alibaba or Tencent (which influence global e-commerce indirectly) are celebrated internally for innovation, not personal glory.</li>
  <li>However, it’s not all rosy. Tech isn’t immune to dishonesty: think of data breaches, addictive algorithms designed for profit over user well-being (e.g., social media feeds), or engineers at companies like Facebook/Meta who’ve been involved in privacy scandals. Some might cut corners for deadlines or bonuses, showing that greed exists everywhere. Still, these issues often stem from corporate pressures rather than individual power-hunting, and many engineers whistleblow or advocate for ethics (e.g., through groups like the ACM Code of Ethics).</li>
  <li>Statistically, professions like engineering rank higher in public trust than politics. Polls (from sources like Gallup) show engineers as trusted for their expertise and low corruption rates, while politicians score poorly. This suggests a perception of honesty, even if it’s not absolute.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-the-broader-contributors-in-the-world">3. <strong>The Broader Contributors in the World</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>You’re right that the world runs on “so many contributors”—not just app developers, but supply chain workers, testers, UI designers, and even non-tech roles like warehouse staff at Walmart or drivers for Grab. These people enable convenience we take for granted, especially across borders (as a Chinese user accessing U.S.-based services like eBay). Their work is interdependent and less hierarchical, which can breed humility and kindness: fixing bugs at 3 AM to keep an app running isn’t glamorous, but it’s service-oriented.</li>
  <li>In a global context, this mirrors philosophical ideas like those in Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching (relevant to Chinese thought), where the “great” leader or contributor is like water—flowing low, nourishing without seeking credit. Power-hunters like presidents might stir waves, but background workers quietly sustain the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-a-balanced-view">4. <strong>A Balanced View</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ultimately, no group is monolithic. Some leaders are genuinely kind and honest (e.g., historical figures like Mandela), while some engineers can be arrogant or unethical. But the structure of their roles matters: power attracts those who crave it, often amplifying flaws, whereas tech work selects for those who enjoy building and solving. If anything, the “background” folks might seem more honest and kind because their impact is positive and unheralded—they’re not in the news for controversies, but for enabling your occasional Uber ride or Amazon order.</li>
  <li>As a Chinese citizen, you might also see parallels in your own tech scene: apps like WeChat or DiDi are powered by dedicated teams, often underappreciated compared to political figures. This global network of contributors highlights how interconnected we are, beyond headlines.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this doesn’t fully address what you meant (your question has a poetic, stream-of-consciousness feel), feel free to clarify! For now, I’d say yes, those engineers and IT workers behind the apps often embody more everyday honesty and kindness, simply because their world rewards quiet competence over conquest.</p>
