<hr />

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible for international students who have obtained a Master’s degree in the UK to stay and work after graduation. The UK has several visa options available to facilitate this transition. Here’s a breakdown of the main routes:</p>

<p><strong>1. The Graduate Route (Post-Study Work Visa):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This visa allows eligible international students who have completed a degree at the undergraduate level or above at a UK Higher Education Provider with a track record of compliance to stay in the UK and work, or look for work, for a specific period after graduation.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Generally, the visa lasts for <strong>two years</strong> for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree holders and <strong>three years</strong> for PhD or other doctoral graduates.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It is an <strong>unsponsored route</strong>, meaning you do not need a job offer to apply.</li>
      <li>You can work in most jobs and at any skill level.</li>
      <li>You have the flexibility to switch jobs.</li>
      <li>You cannot extend this visa. To stay longer, you will likely need to switch to another type of visa, such as the Skilled Worker visa.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You must have a valid Student visa or Tier 4 (General) student visa at the time of application.</li>
      <li>You must have successfully completed a degree at the undergraduate level or above.</li>
      <li>Your education provider must have informed the Home Office of your successful completion.</li>
      <li>You must be in the UK when you apply.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cost (as of early 2025):</strong> The application fee is £822, and you will also need to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), which is currently £1,035 per year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. The Skilled Worker Visa:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a sponsored visa route for individuals who have a job offer from a UK employer approved by the Home Office.</li>
  <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Job Offer:</strong> You need a job offer from a licensed sponsor at an appropriate skill level (RQF level 3 or above).</li>
      <li><strong>Salary:</strong> The salary must meet the minimum salary requirements, which currently stand at <strong>£38,700 per year</strong> for new applicants (as of April 4, 2024), or the ‘going rate’ for the specific job, whichever is higher. However, there are lower salary thresholds for ‘new entrants’ to the labour market, which can include recent graduates. If you are under 26, a recent graduate, or in professional training, the minimum salary can be lower (e.g., £26,100 or 70% of the going rate).</li>
      <li><strong>English Language Proficiency:</strong> You need to prove your English language ability to at least CEFR level B1. A degree from a UK institution usually meets this requirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):</strong> Your sponsoring employer must provide you with a CoS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Switching from a Graduate Visa:</strong> If you find a suitable job while on the Graduate visa, your employer can sponsor you to switch to a Skilled Worker visa, provided you meet the requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Other Potential Visa Routes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High Potential Individual (HPI) Visa:</strong> This visa is for graduates from a list of top global universities (outside the UK). You don’t need a job offer to apply. Successful applicants with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree get a 2-year visa, and PhD holders get a 3-year visa. UK universities are not eligible under this route.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale-up Worker Visa:</strong> This is for individuals with a job offer from a UK scale-up company (a fast-growing company).</li>
  <li><strong>Youth Mobility Scheme Visa:</strong> This is for young people (typically aged 18-30, or up to 35 for some nationalities) from participating countries, allowing them to live and work in the UK for up to two years.</li>
  <li><strong>Global Talent Visa:</strong> This is for individuals who are leaders or potential leaders in fields like science, humanities, engineering, arts, and digital technology. It requires endorsement from a designated body.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Steps to Staying and Working in the UK After Your Master’s:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Explore Your Options:</strong> Understand the different visa routes and their eligibility criteria. The Graduate route is often the most immediate option after graduation.</li>
  <li><strong>Job Search:</strong> Start your job search well before your student visa expires. Utilize university career services, job websites, and networking.</li>
  <li><strong>Meet Visa Requirements:</strong> Ensure you meet all the requirements for the visa you intend to apply for, including financial stability and English language proficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply for the Correct Visa:</strong> Apply for the Graduate visa while your student visa is still valid and you are in the UK. If you secure a job offer later, work with your employer to switch to a Skilled Worker visa if eligible.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Visa Regulations Can Change:</strong> Immigration rules can be subject to change, so always refer to the official UK government website (GOV.UK) for the most up-to-date information.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply for your chosen visa before your current student visa expires.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover visa application fees and living expenses while you look for work (if applying via the Graduate route).</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, obtaining a Master’s degree in the UK opens doors to post-study work opportunities. The Graduate route provides a valuable period to gain work experience or seek long-term employment, which can then lead to other visa options like the Skilled Worker visa.</p>
