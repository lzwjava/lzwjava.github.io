  <li>
    <p>What are the four main principles of OOP in Java? Answer: The four main principles are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object, Inheritance allows class inheritance, Polymorphism enables method overriding and overloading, and Abstraction provides a way to represent essential features without including background details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain the purpose of generics in Java and provide an example. Answer: Generics allow types to be parameterized, enabling code reusability and type safety. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code> uses a type parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> to store elements of any type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you create a thread in Java, and what is its lifecycle? Answer: You can create a thread by extending <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thread</code> or implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Runnable</code>.

Examples include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IOException</code> for checked and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code> for unchecked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you implement serialization in Java, and why is it important? Answer: Serialization is implemented by implementing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Serializable</code> interface.

Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayList</code> is suitable for fast access and traversal, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedList</code> is better for insertions and deletions. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayList</code> uses contiguous memory, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedList</code> uses nodes with pointers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are lambda expressions in Java, and how do they relate to functional interfaces? Answer: Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent one method interface (functional interfaces). They are used for implementing functional interfaces like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Runnable</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Comparator</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain the key operations available in Java Stream API. Answer: Stream API includes intermediate operations (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code>) and terminal operations (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forEach</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collect</code>). They allow for functional-style operations on collections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you use reflection in Java to inspect classes at runtime? Answer: Reflection allows inspection of classes, methods, and fields using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Class.forName()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethods()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getField()</code>. It’s used for dynamic behavior and frameworks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is OAuth2, and how is it used for authorization? Answer: OAuth2 is an authorization framework enabling third-party applications to access resources without sharing credentials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and their role in security. Answer: JWT provides a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties, used for authentication and information exchange.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is RBAC, and how does it simplify access control? Answer: Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions to roles, simplifying user access management by assigning roles to users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you prevent SQL injection attacks? Answer: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to separate code and data, preventing malicious SQL execution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and how can it be prevented? Answer: XSS allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages; it can be prevented by sanitizing inputs and outputs and using security headers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain the importance of encryption in data security. Answer: Encryption protects data confidentiality by converting it into an unreadable format, ensuring only authorized parties can access it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the best practices for secure coding in Java? Answer: Practices include input validation, using secure libraries, and adhering to security guidelines like OWASP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you implement audit trails in applications? Answer: Audit trails log user actions and system events, providing visibility and accountability for security and compliance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is two-factor authentication, and why is it important? Answer: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring two forms of verification, reducing unauthorized access risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe the role of a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Answer: A WAF protects web applications from attacks like SQL injection and XSS by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.</p>

<h3 id="performance-tuning-and-optimization">Performance Tuning and Optimization</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How do you profile Java applications for performance issues? Answer: Use profiling tools like VisualVM or JProfiler to analyze CPU, memory, and thread usage, identifying bottlenecks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is garbage collection tuning, and why is it important? Answer: Garbage collection tuning adjusts JVM parameters to optimize memory management, reducing pauses and improving performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain database query optimization techniques. Answer: Techniques include indexing, query rewriting, and using explain plans to improve query performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What caching strategies are effective in Java applications? Answer: Strategies include local caching, distributed caching (e.g., Redis), and cache expiration policies to balance performance and consistency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you conduct load and stress testing for applications? Answer: Use tools like JMeter or Gatling to simulate high loads, identifying performance limits and bottlenecks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the best practices for optimizing RESTful APIs? Answer: Best practices include minimizing data transfer, using efficient serialization, and caching responses to reduce latency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you reduce network latency in distributed systems? Answer: Techniques include using CDNs, optimizing data centers, and compressing data to minimize transmission time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is connection pool sizing, and how do you determine optimal settings? Answer: Connection pool sizing balances performance and resource usage, determined by analyzing traffic patterns and resource constraints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain the importance of monitoring and alerting in performance management. Answer: Monitoring tracks application health and performance, while alerting ensures timely responses to issues, preventing downtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are common signs of performance bottlenecks in Java applications? Answer: Signs include high CPU usage, memory leaks, slow response times, and increased garbage collection activity.</p>
