<p>The Nature analysis published on April 15, 2025, identifies the 25 most-cited papers of the 21st century, with three authored by University of Toronto computer scientists. Below, I provide details on these three papers and a general overview of the list, as the full list of 25 papers is not explicitly detailed in the available sources but can be partially reconstructed based on the provided information.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01125-9"></a><a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/news/three-papers-authored-by-u-of-t-computer-scientists-among-the-most-cited-of-the-21st-century-nature"></a></p>

<h3 id="papers-by-university-of-toronto-computer-scientists">Papers by University of Toronto Computer Scientists</h3>
<p>The three papers from the University of Toronto’s Department of Computer Science, as highlighted in the Nature analysis, are tied to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning. The most prominent among them is:</p>

      <li><strong>Citations</strong>: While exact citation counts vary by database (e.g., Web of Science, Google Scholar), it has amassed tens of thousands of citations, reflecting its transformative influence.<a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/news/three-papers-authored-by-u-of-t-computer-scientists-among-the-most-cited-of-the-21st-century-nature"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The other two papers authored by University of Toronto researchers are not explicitly named in the provided sources, but they are described as being closely tied to the department’s AI research legacy. Given the context, they likely involve work by Geoffrey Hinton or his collaborators, focusing on deep learning or related AI methodologies. These could include papers on neural network architectures, optimization techniques, or applications of deep learning, published in high-impact venues like Nature, NeurIPS, or IEEE conferences.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-the-25-most-cited-papers">Overview of the 25 Most-Cited Papers</h3>
<p>The Nature analysis, based on citation data from five databases (Web of Science, Scopus, OpenAlex, Dimensions, and Google Scholar), emphasizes that the most-cited papers of the 21st century often describe methods and tools rather than groundbreaking discoveries. The top 25 papers span several fields, with a strong presence of AI, research software, statistical methods, and psychology. Key points about the list include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Top Paper</strong>: The most-cited paper is “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition” (2016) by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun, published in the Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). It introduced ResNets (deep residual learning networks), which have been pivotal for AI tools like ChatGPT and AlphaGo. Citation counts range from 103,756 to 254,074 across databases.<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3307118/ai-paper-4-chinese-paved-way-chatgpt-alphago-its-set-greater-glory-2030"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Other Notable Papers</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A 2006 paper on thematic analysis in psychology by Victoria Clarke (co-authored with Ginny Braun) ranks third, with citations between 100,000 and 230,000.<a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/news/nature-most-cited-paper"></a></li>
      <li>A 2004 paper on graphene experiments, which led to a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010, is also among the top 25, highlighting the diversity of influential topics.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01125-9"></a></li>
      <li>Papers on research software (e.g., scikit-learn) and statistical methods are prevalent, reflecting their widespread use across disciplines.<a href="https://www.doradolist.com/papers/21-most-cited-machine-learning-papers"></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>AI Dominance</strong>: AI-related papers, especially in deep learning and computer vision, are heavily represented, with high citation counts driven by their applicability in fields like self-driving cars and natural language processing.<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/google-scholar-reveals-most-influential-papers-research-citations-twenty-twenty"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="limitations-and-notes">Limitations and Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The full list of the 25 papers is not provided in the sources, as Nature includes a complete list in its Supplementary Information, which is not publicly accessible in the given data.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01125-9"></a></li>
  <li>Citation counts vary significantly across databases due to differences in indexing (e.g., Google Scholar reports higher counts than Web of Science). The Nature analysis uses the median rank across databases to determine the top 25.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01125-9"></a></li>
  <li>The University of Toronto’s contributions are part of a broader trend where AI papers, particularly those on deep learning, have seen rapid citation growth due to their practical impact and online visibility.<a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/news/three-papers-authored-by-u-of-t-computer-scientists-among-the-most-cited-of-the-21st-century-nature"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-access-the-full-list">How to Access the Full List</h3>
<p>To obtain the complete list of the 25 most-cited papers, you can refer to the original Nature article published on April 15, 2025, titled “Exclusive: the most-cited papers of the twenty-first century” (DOI: 10.1038/d41586-025-01125-9). The Supplementary Information accompanying the article contains the detailed list.
