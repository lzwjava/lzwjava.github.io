  <p>Identifying the “biggest stars” in the International Olympiads—International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), and International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)—over recent decades involves looking at participants who have achieved exceptional results, such as multiple gold medals, perfect or near-perfect scores, or notable contributions to their fields later in life. Below, I highlight standout performers based on available data, focusing on their achievements in these competitions and, where relevant, their broader impact. The information is drawn from web sources, including Wikipedia and Olympiad websites, and reflects results up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, with some extrapolation for recent trends.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="international-mathematical-olympiad-imo"><strong>International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)</strong></h3>

<p>The IMO, the oldest and most prestigious of the science Olympiads, has seen numerous standout performers since its inception in 1959. In recent decades, the following individuals stand out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lisa Sauermann (Germany)</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Achievements</strong>: Competed in IMO from 2007 to 2011, earning four gold medals and one silver, with a perfect score in 2011. She is the only female participant to achieve a perfect score and ranks among the all-time top scorers with a cumulative score of 184 points across five years.</li>
      <li><strong>Notable Impact</strong>: Sauermann pursued a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford and is now a professor at MIT, specializing in combinatorics. Her IMO success marked her as a prodigy, and her academic career has solidified her reputation.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trends and Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IMO awards medals to the top 50% of participants, with gold for the top 1/12. Perfect scores (42/42) are rare, achieved by fewer than 60 participants in history.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad"></a></li>
  <li>Countries like China, the United States, and South Korea have dominated team rankings in recent decades, with China winning the unofficial team title 20 times since 1990.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_medal_count_at_International_Mathematical_Olympiad"></a></li>
  <li>Recent stars (post-2010) are harder to pinpoint due to limited long-term data, but names like Zhuoqun (Alex) Song (USA, five golds from 2010–2014) and Yang Liu (China, multiple golds and perfect scores) appear in results.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="international-olympiad-in-informatics-ioi"><strong>International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</strong></h3>

<p>The IOI, focused on competitive programming, has produced stars known for their algorithmic prowess, many of whom excel in tech industries. Notable performers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gennady Korotkevich (Belarus)</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Achievements</strong>: Competed in IOI from 2006 to 2012, winning six gold medals and one silver, with perfect scores in 2009, 2010, and 2012. He holds the record for most IOI gold medals and is often called the greatest competitive programmer ever.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="general-observations-and-challenges"><strong>General Observations and Challenges</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Gaps</strong>: Comprehensive individual records are more available for IMO and IOI due to their larger participant pools and longer histories. IPhO and IChO data are less centralized, making it harder to identify multi-year stars without accessing specific national or Olympiad archives.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Impact</strong>: Olympiad stars often become role models in their countries. For example, Terence Tao’s IMO success is celebrated in Australia, and Gennady Korotkevich’s IOI dominance inspires Belarusian programmers.</li>
  <li><strong>Career Trajectories</strong>: Many Olympiad stars pursue STEM careers at top institutions (e.g., MIT, Stanford, Google). Their early success signals exceptional problem-solving and dedication, traits valued in academia and industry.</li>
  <li><strong>Geopolitical Issues</strong>: Recent Olympiads have faced challenges, such as Russia’s ban from IMO since 2022 due to the Ukraine invasion and Israel’s restriction to individual participation in IOI 2025 due to the Gaza conflict. These affect team dynamics but not individual brilliance.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"></a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>The biggest stars in recent decades include <strong>Lisa Sauermann</strong>, <strong>Terence Tao</strong>, and <strong>Reid Barton</strong> (IMO); <strong>Gennady Korotkevich</strong>, <strong>Petr Mitrichev</strong>, and <strong>Zhezheng Luo</strong> (IOI); <strong>Stanislav Fort</strong> and <strong>Chen Sun</strong> (IPhO); and <strong>Soham Dutta</strong> and <strong>Yuan Gan</strong> (IChO). These individuals not only dominated their competitions but also made significant contributions to mathematics, computer science, physics, and chemistry. For the most recent stars (post-2020), data is less conclusive, but top performers from countries like China, the U.S., and India continue to emerge annually.</p>

<p>If you’d like me to dig deeper into specific years, countries, or participants (e.g., 2023–2025 results), I can search for real-time data or analyze specific Olympiad archives. Let me know!</p>
