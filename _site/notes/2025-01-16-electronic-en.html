  <li>
    <p>Power Diodes: Power diodes are used to control the flow of current in high-power applications, such as rectifying AC to DC power. They are designed to handle higher voltage and current than regular diodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thyristors: A type of semiconductor device used for switching and controlling large amounts of power. Thyristors include SCRs (Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers) and TRIACs, commonly used in motor control, lighting, and power regulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power MOSFETs: Power MOSFETs are used for switching and amplifying in power electronic circuits, particularly in power supplies, motor drives, and inverters, due to their high efficiency and fast switching characteristics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IGBTs (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors): IGBTs combine the characteristics of both BJTs and MOSFETs and are used in high-power applications like inverters, motor drives, and induction heating systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DC-DC Converters: DC-DC converters are used to convert one DC voltage level to another, either stepping up (boost converters) or stepping down (buck converters) the voltage, with high efficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AC-DC Converters: These converters, also known as rectifiers, are used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). They are widely used in power supplies and in applications where DC voltage is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inverters: Inverters convert DC to AC power and are used in renewable energy systems, UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supplies), and electric vehicles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Control: Power control in electronic systems involves regulating voltage and current levels for efficient energy use, often through feedback loops, modulation, and switching regulators.</p>
  </li>
