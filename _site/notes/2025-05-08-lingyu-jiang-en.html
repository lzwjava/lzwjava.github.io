  <p>Jiang Lingyu (Chinese: 蒋凌宇; pinyin: Jiǎng Língyǔ), born in 2003 in Chongqing, China, is widely recognized as one of the world’s top competitive programmers, known online by the handle “jiangly.” Starting his competitive programming journey at age 11 in 2014, he has risen to prominence through exceptional performances in major international contests, earning accolades such as a silver medal at Google Code Jam 2022 and a bronze medal at Meta Hacker Cup 2021. Currently a student at Peking University’s School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Jiang has achieved a rare Codeforces rating above 4000, making him one of only two programmers, alongside Gennady Korotkevich (“tourist”), to reach the prestigious “Legendary Grandmaster” tier named after Korotkevich.</p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h3>
<p>Jiang was born in Chongqing and attended the High School Affiliated to Southwest University, where he honed his skills in local and national programming competitions. His early start in competitive programming at age 11 allowed him to build a strong foundation in algorithms and problem-solving. By his teens, he was already competing at a high level, earning a spot on the candidate list for China’s International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) team in 2021. His academic path led him to Peking University, where he continues to balance rigorous studies with competitive programming.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-programming-achievements">Competitive Programming Achievements</h3>
<p>Jiang’s competitive programming career is marked by consistent excellence across platforms like Codeforces, Google Code Jam, Meta Hacker Cup, and ICPC. Key highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Code Jam 2022</strong>: Secured 2nd place globally, earning a silver medal and cementing his reputation as a top-tier coder.<a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/lingyu-jiang/"></a><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Lingyu_Jiang"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Meta Hacker Cup 2021</strong>: Won a bronze medal with a 3rd-place finish, showcasing his ability to tackle complex algorithmic challenges.<a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/lingyu-jiang/"></a><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Lingyu_Jiang"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Codeforces</strong>: Achieved a peak rating of 4039, currently holding a rating of 3859 as a Legendary Grandmaster. He has solved over 6,700 problems on the platform, with 949 solved in the last year alone (as of May 2025). His contributions to the community include blog posts and problem-setting for contests.<a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/jiangly"></a><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/jiangly?locale=en"></a><a href="https://cf.nytdoj.com/profile/jiangly?locale=en"></a></li>
  <li><strong>ICPC</strong>: As part of Peking University’s team, Jiang contributed to winning the 2022 ICPC Asia-East Continent Final Contest, demonstrating his strength in team-based competitions.<a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Lingyu_Jiang"></a></li>
  <li><strong>Universal Cup and Other Contests</strong>: Jiang has been involved in organizing and participating in high-quality mirror contests through the Universal Cup, a non-profit initiative to provide training for competitive programming teams.<a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/jiangly"></a></li>
</ul>

<p>His Codeforces profile reflects his dominance, with a massive following (over 14,000 friends) and consistent activity, including a recent streak of solving problems 17 days in a row. His handle “jiangly” is synonymous with precision and speed, often ranking among the top performers in global leaderboards.</p>

<h3 id="programming-style-and-philosophy">Programming Style and Philosophy</h3>
<p>Jiang’s approach to competitive programming emphasizes deep algorithmic knowledge, strategic planning, and continuous learning. In interviews, he has highlighted the importance of creating mind maps for problem requirements, double-checking solutions, and mastering fundamentals like software engineering and language syntax. His ability to solve complex problems under time constraints, as seen in onsite competitions like Topcoder’s TCO19, underscores his comprehensive skill set.<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/blog/an-interview-with-tco19-development-champion-jiangliwu"></a></p>

<h3 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions</h3>
<p>Beyond competing, Jiang contributes to the programming community through blog posts on Codeforces, where he discusses technical issues like bugs in contest platforms and shares insights on problem-solving. He is also involved in the Universal Cup, helping organize mirror contests for undisclosed ICPC and regional competition sets, fostering opportunities for aspiring programmers worldwide.<a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/jiangly"></a></p>

<h3 id="personal-traits-and-interests">Personal Traits and Interests</h3>
<p>Jiang is known for his humility and dedication, often described as a “Godlike” figure in competitive programming circles due to his extraordinary talent. Outside coding, he enjoys learning new technologies, playing games, and reading literary books and fiction. His ability to balance academics, competitions, and personal growth reflects his disciplined mindset.<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/blog/an-interview-with-tco19-development-champion-jiangliwu"></a></p>

<h3 id="impact-and-legacy">Impact and Legacy</h3>
<p>Jiang’s rise to a 4000+ Codeforces rating in January 2025 sparked discussions in the programming community, with many celebrating his challenge to Gennady Korotkevich’s long-standing dominance. His achievements have inspired programmers globally, particularly in China, where he is a role model for young coders. His contributions to contest organization and problem-setting further solidify his influence, ensuring that high-quality programming challenges remain accessible to the next generation.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1i6posw/jiangly_is_tourist_on_codeforces_now_tourist_is/"></a></p>

<h3 id="clarifications-and-notes">Clarifications and Notes</h3>
<p>There is some ambiguity in sources regarding Jiang’s gender, with references using both “he” and “she.” Based on the majority of sources, including Codeforces and competitive programming profiles, Jiang is referred to as male. Additionally, profiles like those on LinkedIn mentioning other individuals named Lingyu Jiang (e.g., in automotive or medical fields) are unrelated to the competitive programmer.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingyu-jiang-7197ba86/"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingyu-jiang-542048138/"></a></p>

<p>For a comprehensive list of Jiang’s achievements, the Competitive Programming Hall of Fame website provides detailed records. His ongoing contributions and competitive prowess continue to shape the global programming landscape, making him a standout figure in the field.<a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Lingyu_Jiang"></a><a href="https://cphof.org/profile/codeforces:jiangly"></a></p>
