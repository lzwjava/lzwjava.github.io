<hr />

<p>Perhaps it is fate that destined me to fight against falsehoods in this lifetime. From a young age, my parents told me that there were many smart people in the world, and that if you had ability, you could have a good life. So I needed to study hard. I believed them, and I was always an excellent student. But…</p>

<p>(At this point, a lengthy account is omitted—please refer to my previous article <em>The Shattering of the Tsinghua Dream</em>.)</p>

<p>After meeting my mentor Dan Friedman, I felt I had truly learned the ability to think critically. This ability was something I had as a child but had lost through subsequent “education.” My smooth experience at IU made me feel like no problem could stump me. Naively, I thought that having this genuine ability would naturally lead to satisfying work and life. But once again, I was wrong.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I joined Google that I realized that the workplace wasn’t about the strongest abilities getting the best positions. On the contrary, those who were smooth talkers and adept at leveraging others’ talents were the ones who climbed to the top. In a way, that was the “shattering of the Google dream,” though I never had a “Google dream” to begin with. Google often claimed, “We don’t care about your degree; if you have the ability, you’ll get a good job.” Now we know those were lies.</p>

<p>Later, in San Francisco, I met Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python. By then, he had left Google. He said to me, “The world still values degrees. You know, I only have a master’s degree, and that puts me at a disadvantage in the corporate world.” I was stunned that even Guido van Rossum would say something like that, but it was true. Now we know that the companies that once touted “we don’t care about degrees” (including Google) eventually used degrees to suppress people.</p>

<p>But even a PhD doesn’t solve everything. It might make things a bit easier, but not by much. Some of my PhD friends still toil away working for people without real skills. I’ve come to understand that this world is filled with falsehoods from top to bottom. From space hoaxes to nuclear weapon scams, pandemic frauds, and even fake wars—it shows that the world’s power is controlled by a few evil masters of deception. If that’s the case, how can ordinary corporate jobs be any different?</p>

<p>I remember how many students “got by” in college. Those who couldn’t code, or coded terribly, would always find ways to join a good team with a strong programmer. They’d then put on their act—pretending to be proactive, doing surface-level tasks like research, writing reports, or creating documentation—but avoiding any real coding. When they did write code, it was so poor it gave them away: chaotic while loops spanning hundreds of lines, poorly written functions, or fragile hacks that happened to work by luck.</p>

<p>Capable team members could always tell what these people were really like. But universities are “harmonious” places, so capable individuals, out of “politeness” or a sense of “friendliness,” wouldn’t call them out. Professors didn’t care about such issues either; they only cared about whether the group delivered overall. And so, by attaching themselves to strong teams, these individuals graduated with “excellent” grades.</p>

<p>When such people enter the workplace, they use the same tactics. They leverage others’ skills, adding a few lines of their own to existing work so their names appear in the codebase. They enthusiastically contribute to documentation or research tasks but avoid actual coding. Once again, capable colleagues—out of politeness—don’t expose them. Over time, these people climb higher, eventually reaching senior leadership positions.</p>

<p>Because the world itself is built on falsehoods, such individuals are always promoted. The fake higher-ups promote people like themselves, as long as they can exploit those with genuine skills to do the work. This is how most companies operate, regardless of their lofty slogans or claims of being “engineer-driven” or having an “engineering culture.”</p>

<p>People say “Life begins at forty” or that one reaches clarity at forty. But how many truly do? I didn’t. Many people live their entire lives in a grand illusion.</p>

<p>For me, clarity came at forty-two. At forty-two, while living in an apartment on the 42nd floor of a building in Shanghai, I uncovered the secrets of this world. At the start of the year, I had whimsically thought that since “42 is the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything,” maybe this would be a year of breakthroughs for me. And it was. I gained a deep understanding of music theory, practiced the cello, viola da gamba, and Baroque flute. But my greatest breakthrough wasn’t in specific skills—it was seeing through the deceptions of the world.</p>

<p>This led me to investigate physics, where I began studying Einstein’s theories of relativity. Initially, I sought to understand them, but eventually, I realized they might be wrong. Herbert Dingle’s book <em>Science at the Crossroads</em> pointed out flaws in relativity, though it didn’t identify the true errors. A year later, after thoroughly reading Einstein’s papers, I understood where his “special relativity” was fundamentally flawed: the premise of “constant speed of light” is incorrect and has not been experimentally proven. The Michelson-Morley experiment’s conclusions were wrong.</p>

<p>From there, I uncovered more falsehoods: the AIDS scam, the pandemic hoax, the space hoax, and even the nuclear weapons hoax, where Einstein’s E=mc² laid the groundwork for the deception that “a small amount of mass can release enormous energy.”</p>

<p>But at that time, it was a seed that led me to start doubting everything in this world, including the very person who told people to “doubt everything”—René Descartes. I discovered that Descartes was a fraud as well. In his <em>Meditations</em>, he claimed that one should doubt everything, empty one’s mind, and rebuild all knowledge from scratch. Yet after “emptying all the contents of his mind,” he declared, “Now I know only one thing to be true—the existence of God.” He was clearly referring to the God in the <em>Bible</em>, which made me realize he was a fake. His entire <em>Meditations</em> is nonsense.</p>

<p>Being confined during the pandemic, I suddenly thought that maybe I should take some time to understand what the pandemic was really about—perhaps there was something wrong with it. I asked a friend who liked to study politics. This friend often talked to me about how evil the United States was, so I figured he might have done some research. Indeed, he had looked into the pandemic and told me it was likely the work of devils like Bill Gates and Fauci.</p>

<p>However, he hadn’t pinpointed what exactly was false about the pandemic. He thought that some villains with advanced technology had created the coronavirus, but he didn’t consider the possibility that “viruses” might not exist at all. Later, he enthusiastically went to get three doses of the vaccine—all domestically produced, of course, because he despised the United States and supported domestic products. Fortunately, he’s still alive 😄.</p>

<p>After further investigation, I came across the book <em>Virus Mania</em>, which claims that all “viruses” in the world are fake and that the entire field of virology is pseudoscience. It argues that no one has scientifically proven the existence of viruses. I then discovered that the idea of “viruses don’t exist” originated from a German biologist named Stefan Lanka. While I don’t entirely believe Lanka’s claims, I did examine two officially published virology papers that purportedly prove the existence of the coronavirus. Sure enough, as Lanka suggested, neither conducted proper scientific control experiments and both were vague on this critical issue.</p>

<p>Following this thread, I discovered that AIDS was also a scam. I came across works by Kary Mullis and Peter Duesberg. These two are not conspiracy theorists but reputable scientists. Peter Duesberg wrote an entire book, <em>Inventing the AIDS Virus</em>, exposing the “AIDS epidemic” hoax and the fraudulent nature of virology. He pointed out that circular reasoning is often used to “prove the existence of viruses.” Many fail to see the connections, but I found that the scripts for the “AIDS hoax” and the “COVID hoax” are identical, performed by the same group of actors.</p>

<p>I believe Stefan Lanka is correct: viruses do not exist. However, he did not uncover the source of “symptoms.” All those who claim “viruses don’t exist” have also failed to explain where “COVID symptoms” come from. Some proponents of the “viruses don’t exist” theory later began claiming that “COVID symptoms are caused by 5G electromagnetic waves,” which confirmed for me that these people are also actors—”antagonist characters” planted by the Matrix to confuse the public. My final experiences in China, along with various bizarre encounters in the UK, led me to conclude that the “symptoms” likely come from various secret poisoning operations (smog, airplane chemtrails, “chemical air fresheners” in public places, etc.).</p>

<p>Next came revelations about the “space hoax,” the “nuclear weapons hoax,” and so on. Einstein’s E=mc² was likely created to support the “nuclear weapons hoax,” making people believe that “a tiny bit of matter can be converted into an immense amount of energy.” Then, after the pandemic ended, the “AI hoax,” paused for three years by the pandemic, returned with a vengeance through ChatGPT, while the once-hyped “autonomous driving” quietly disappeared…</p>

<p>With so many deceptions and illusions in the world, perhaps the question we should ask is: What is real?</p>

<p>At the age of 42, I finally found true clarity. I understood that “The Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything” is indeed—42. But how can one comprehend this answer without seeing through all the falsehoods first? Therefore, the answer can only be 42—utterly meaningless.</p>

<p>I’m not saying life is meaningless, but that attempting to answer any profound questions like these is meaningless until one sees through these illusions.</p>
