  <p>Do not just talk about how much you love your parents; instead, help with household chores every day and experience the years of hard work your parents have put in. At the very least, do your share of household chores.</p>

<p>Don’t just claim you love your customers; write the code, negotiate with suppliers for the best prices, ensure good designs, manage your employees well, and put in the effort to get things done efficiently every day.</p>

<p>Be a responsible individual. Understand your role, who you are creating value for, and who you depend on to survive. Know your responsibilities.</p>

<p>Don’t talk about emotions; emotions are cheap. Focus on interests and make sure the benefits are clear.</p>

<p>Instead of professing your love for someone, take on the responsibilities you have in the family and earn money outside.</p>

<p>Don’t rely on emotions or friendships in business; approach business with a professional attitude, just like dealing with strangers and online acquaintances. Put interests on the table.</p>

<p>Learn from Apple; focus on product development throughout the year and hold only two events annually. Work hard behind the scenes and speak up only when necessary.</p>

<p>As a content creator, talk every day, but remember to share something valuable to others. Talking without substance is useless. Speak about things that can benefit others, even strangers.</p>

<p>If you don’t speak up about things that are useful to others, that’s okay. But then, you have to accept the reality that you won’t make money and won’t be able to provide value to others.</p>

<p>As a short video creator, make videos daily, but ensure they provide value or bring joy and knowledge to others. If you only create content for yourself, don’t complain about the lack of followers.</p>

<p>At work, focus on doing your job well. You don’t need to talk about anything beyond your work responsibilities. If you perform well and deliver quickly, every boss will appreciate you.</p>

<p>As a leader, calculate the interests, evaluate employees’ input and output, and determine if the wages you pay today will generate returns from customers in the future.</p>

<p>In business, spend money wisely, considering if each investment will bring returns in the future.</p>

<p>If you lack skills and like to talk without substance, people will naturally dislike and disdain you.</p>

<p>When selling oranges, there’s no need for brand storytelling; sell delicious and cost-effective oranges.</p>

<p>When selling courses or training, focus on offering excellent and cost-effective content.</p>

<p>If you want people to like you, become outstanding and share your expertise generously.</p>

<p>To make money, don’t talk too much; present a great product or service with good value.</p>

<p>Simplicity and common sense hold the greatest power. Things don’t have to be complicated; they can be simple and straightforward.</p>

<p>Words and ideas have value, but consider their originality, uniqueness, correctness, and usefulness.</p>

<p>When dealing with people, be considerate.</p>

<p>This world is realistic.</p>

<p>As an adult, first, take care of yourself and avoid causing trouble for others. Understand who you depend on to live.</p>

<p>Don’t rely on emotions, storytelling, or sentiments because people buy products, goods, or services, not emotions.</p>

<p>Using emotions and storytelling often means your products or services are not good enough. Reliance on emotions can be perceived as a manipulative tactic.</p>

<p>In the world of money, be rational. Don’t try to please others who don’t need your products or services. Instead, focus on improving what you offer. Emotions are not sustainable; not everyone values them.</p>

<p>Ensure fair and reasonable business practices to maintain long-term relationships.</p>

<p>In the world of money, tears are worthless. Tears can’t replace hard work and daily efforts.</p>

<p>For accomplishing things, actively seek cooperation when needed, but make sure you have already done your best.</p>

<p>Surviving in this world is simple. Just like Apple, work hard to become exceptional, be dedicated, and make people need you.</p>

<p>Don’t force yourself too much. Let passion be your driving force. But if you don’t put much effort into something, be content with the money you earn. Accept the harsh reality of the market when people choose other products or services over yours. There are rules to money and business.</p>

<p>In society, take action instead of just talking, and complete tasks efficiently. For those who wish to grow their presence as content creators or short video makers, be serious in both speech and action.</p>

<p>I write this to motivate myself. Good morning, workers. Keep going, workers.</p>
