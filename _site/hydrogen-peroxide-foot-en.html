  <p>When I was in middle school, I had athlete’s foot. Sometimes parts of my foot were white, and the skin would peel off, leaving some dead skin. It seemed my foot had been sweating for a long time. When I came back home, my parents would help me wash my foot. It shocked them.</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I became less involved in sports. Though I knew my feet usually smelled, especially in the summer, I ignored it for years.</p>

<p>In recent years, I read Yin Wang’s articles about athlete’s foot. He tried many ways, and in the comments of some product, he saw someone mention hydrogen peroxide to cure athlete’s foot.</p>

<p>Around 2023, I initially experimented with hydrogen peroxide, but my usage was inconsistent. I observed bubbles forming on my slippers. The 3% hydrogen peroxide solution I bought was inexpensive, costing about 30 CNY for a 5-liter bottle. I also purchased several 500 ml bottles filled with hydrogen peroxide, costing about 5 CNY each. However, I only used the solution once or twice before leaving the bottles mostly unused.</p>

<p>About a year later, I tried using the solution again, but it had lost its effectiveness; the bubbles no longer appeared on the slippers.</p>

<p>So, I bought a new bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and it worked well. After using it and rubbing my foot, the unpleasant smell was significantly reduced.</p>

<p>I’ve lived in Guangzhou, China, in recent years. So in the summer, even in a room with air conditioning, the smell of feet is unpleasant. I wear slippers at home and sandals in the office, so my feet are usually exposed to the air. It’s really important to have clean feet, not just for others but for myself.</p>

<p>I began to learn more about hydrogen peroxide with AI chatbots. It’s a useful chemical ingredient. To save hydrogen peroxide, I started using disposable foot covers. After soaking my feet, I use the remaining liquid to soak my slippers and sandals.</p>
