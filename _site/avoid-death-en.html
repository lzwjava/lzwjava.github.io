  <p>I am about to turn 30 years old. I didn’t know much about death growing up until 2019, when one of my relatives died. In 2022, another relative passed away. I learned that two of my classmates had also died. During the three-year COVID period, we witnessed a lot of death in the news.</p>

<p>As a responsible human being, I want to share the lessons I have learned from these experiences.</p>

<h2 id="be-careful-in-life-do-not-fall-from-heights">Be Careful in Life, Do Not Fall from Heights</h2>

<p>There are many high places in the city. If one isn’t careful enough, a fall could cause severe injury or even be fatal.</p>

<p>Our brains are easily injured when falling. Long ago, there weren’t many tall buildings on Earth. Human beings need to adapt to new living patterns.</p>

<h2 id="be-optimistic-cultivate-a-social-life">Be Optimistic, Cultivate a Social Life</h2>

<p>Once you get older, your life cycle starts to remain unchanged—just family, colleagues, and a few friends. With fewer people to share with, you have fewer interactions with others.</p>

<p>As your life depends largely on work and family, be careful to maintain a good family atmosphere and good work relationships with colleagues.</p>

<p>And learn to deal with stress. Stress is a large part of modern life. We need to learn more, understand how other people live in this world, and know how people lived long ago. We need to read a lot to gain correct views about things.</p>

<h2 id="be-self-disciplined-avoid-gambling-and-tons-of-debt">Be Self-Disciplined, Avoid Gambling and Tons of Debt</h2>

<p>Gambling is bad behavior with high risks. It is not rational. Gambling easily makes you lose a lot of money quickly and can lead to depression.</p>

<p>Tons of debt are something we need to avoid. It seems we can’t avoid a mortgage because we need a house. This is not true. I found that in 2024, I had lost 1 million CNY when I bought a house in Guangzhou in 2022. I was unhappy for a long time, but then I reflected a lot and came to the conclusion that the housing dream is ending. Information, knowledge software, AI, and crypto are the future. I wrote an article titled “The End of the Housing Dream.”</p>

<p>Once your mind accepts the loss, you will be calm about it. So I decided to accept this truth and carry on without complaining much about it again.</p>

<p>It is house mortgage. Other types of gambling will make things worse. I have heard of some cases in my surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="be-careful-of-scams-or-crimes">Be Careful of Scams or Crimes</h2>

<p>My experience in the USA has not been very positive in terms of safety. A friend told me not to go to places where people gather in the USA, like music carnivals, and to be careful not to go to dangerous places in cities. That’s true—it can be scary. Although it may limit your activities, avoiding these kinds of dangerous situations allows you to enjoy many other aspects of life.</p>

<h2 id="be-healthy-and-treat-your-body-well">Be Healthy and Treat Your Body Well</h2>

<p>Some people I know have died from cancer. These deaths were often the result of unhealthy behaviors. This has led me to become more health-conscious in recent years. I’ve written articles such as “Pay Attention to Food Freshness” and “Eat Fruits Instead of Snacks.” Other advice I offer includes choosing more natural foods and exercising more.</p>

<h2 id="caring-for-family-and-teaching-children-about-safety">Caring for Family and Teaching Children About Safety</h2>

<p>Family well-being has a profound impact on us. Therefore, health and safety are of utmost importance to us. Teaching children to be wary of strangers is beyond doubt. Children are often innocent and easily trust others. However, there are still bad people and criminal acts in the world, so we must be vigilant.</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>

<p>As one grows up, one will encounter more death and birth. It seems that death is unavoidable, though AI and technology are helping us live longer. So make sure that in our limited life, we have some fulfillment. We achieve the impossible. We fulfill some of our dreams. Live a life with no regrets and live it fully.</p>
