  <p>There have been some car accidents in my life. The most severe one happened in April 2018, just one month after I got my driver’s license. I was traveling to Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia. I was driving about 100 km/h with my wife. After exiting the highway at a toll booth, which didn’t have a curved road and was straight, I thought I was still on the highway. So, I didn’t slow down at all. Suddenly, there was a crossroad.</p>

<p>My car crashed into a white car that was just making a turn. My car was pushed about 10 meters away. Things got messy. The other car was pushed into the road divider. I was fine because I was wearing my seatbelt, and I didn’t have any injuries. However, my wife had some shoulder problems.</p>

<p>I could see that the other car was badly hit. I went to check on the situation. I was afraid that I might have seriously injured someone. Upon checking, I found a male driver alone in the car, with his head bleeding. I called for medical emergency services and the police.</p>

<p>Actually, we were lucky. Before hitting his car, there was a big truck in front of us. We were glad that this big truck was driving fast and missed our car. Otherwise, our car might have gone under the truck, which could have been very dangerous for us.</p>

<p>Later, the insurance company for my car helped me. I had just bought the second-hand car half a month before the accident, so the insurance was under the original owner of my car.</p>

<p>The police found that the driver of the white car had consumed a significant amount of alcohol. Consequently, the next day, the police decided to hold both of us equally responsible, splitting the fault fifty-fifty.</p>

<p>This accident left a lifelong memory for me. Later accidents I’ve had have been trivial. I am glad that the car accidents in my life have not killed me. I record this here to wish for fewer car accidents in my later life, and I hope the same for you.</p>
