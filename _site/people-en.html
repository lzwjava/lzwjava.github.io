  <p>ChatGPT Translation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Because of entrepreneurship, nearly 9000 users added me on WeChat, and both of my WeChat accounts are full. Through this entrepreneurial journey, I have also met various founders, engineers, and friends from the internet industry. Along the way, I have maintained numerous relationships with family, girlfriend, close friends, relatives, business partners, employees, commercial collaborators, users, familiar friends, casual friends, and even those who dislike me. There have been successful and amicable collaborations, as well as unavoidable conflicts, arguments, and being deleted or blocked. Allow me to share some insights I’ve learned from these experiences about interpersonal communication.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-best-relationships-are-those-built-on-collaboration">1. The Best Relationships are Those Built on Collaboration.</h3>

<p>Many of us aspire to achieve a successful career or venture. The people who can best help us accomplish these dreams are the ones we should be grateful for and invest our energy in maintaining relationships with. These are the trusted partners, the brothers in arms with whom we make significant money, the mentors who aid our growth, and the supportive colleagues.</p>

<p>For instance, my best relationship is with my childhood friend, whom I also have as a partner in my outsourcing company. I handle negotiations and promotion, while he takes care of the core software development. Together, we share the profits. Another crucial relationship for me, during my time with a live-streaming product, was with the anchors and core users who helped promote the platform and bring in new users. Their content and audience helped me achieve my goals, and in return, I promoted their live sessions.</p>

<p>The lesson here is to focus on your objectives and be open to collaboration and seeking help without specifically trying to build a network of relationships. Working with others toward common goals naturally strengthens bonds. If you are not involved in joint endeavors, it’s okay to have less contact; everyone has their own lives, and you can reach out when needed.</p>

<p>Focus your time on achieving your significant goals, and let your network of relationships revolve around those objectives.</p>

<h3 id="2-spend-more-time-with-people-you-can-collaborate-with">2. Spend More Time with People You Can Collaborate With</h3>

<p>While it’s great to know influential individuals, such as founders of successful companies or industry celebrities, spending too much time trying to connect with them might not yield practical collaborations. Instead, focus on individuals with whom you can genuinely cooperate and who appreciate and support you. Engage in projects and activities together, have meaningful conversations, and introduce potential partners when relevant.</p>

<h3 id="3-prioritize-your-time-and-learn-to-decline-some-requests">3. Prioritize Your Time and Learn to Decline Some Requests</h3>

<p>Time is limited for everyone; each day has only 24 hours. It’s crucial to use it wisely and avoid spending it on low-impact activities. Politely decline requests that don’t align with your priorities or work. When someone seeks help or advice, ensure you understand their background and intentions before deciding whether to collaborate.</p>

<p>Always try to respond to others, even when declining their requests. A simple acknowledgement can go a long way in maintaining a positive relationship.</p>

<h3 id="4-be-open-and-transparent-about-when-people-can-approach-you">4. Be Open and Transparent About When People Can Approach You</h3>

<p>Maintain openness and transparency about your availability and needs. Share updates with others, let them know what you are working on, and express what kind of assistance or collaborations you are seeking. This approach can lead to numerous opportunities and potential partnerships.</p>

<h3 id="5-understand-others-backgrounds-and-proactively-seek-help">5. Understand Others’ Backgrounds and Proactively Seek Help</h3>

<p>Be proactive in seeking assistance from others. Ensure you understand their backgrounds and interests, and make clear and concise introductions when connecting with new people. Being transparent about your own objectives and needs will make it easier for others to assist you.</p>

<h3 id="6-seek-help-from-friends-and-be-understanding">6. Seek Help from Friends and Be Understanding</h3>

<p>Don’t hesitate to ask friends for help; most people are willing to assist if you make your needs clear. Be understanding if someone declines your request, as they might be busy or have their own reasons. Keep in mind that everyone has their own attitude towards social interactions.</p>

<h3 id="7-spend-more-time-with-people-who-care-about-you">7. Spend More Time with People Who Care About You</h3>

<p>Prioritize the people who genuinely care about you and invest time in building deeper trust with them. Collaborate on various endeavors and projects together to strengthen your bonds and relationships.</p>

<h3 id="8-be-tolerant-of-others">8. Be Tolerant of Others</h3>

<p>People are diverse, and their behavior can vary based on their emotional states. Try to understand others and their actions better, and be tolerant of differences and disagreements.</p>

<h3 id="9-strengthen-yourself-and-you-will-strengthen-all">9. Strengthen Yourself, and You Will Strengthen All</h3>

<p>By continuously improving yourself and increasing your capabilities, you will be better equipped to handle interpersonal interactions, collaborate with outstanding individuals, and overcome challenges. As you grow stronger, you will be less affected by negative criticism or harmful actions from others.</p>

<p>In conclusion, focus on meaningful actions and cooperation, seek help when needed, be understanding, and continually strive to improve yourself. Through these practices, you will foster stronger and more productive relationships in your personal and professional life.</p>
