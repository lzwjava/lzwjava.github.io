  <p>I recommend this reclining pillow. I bought it in March 2023. It cost me around 270 CNY. Today, (Jan 5, 2025), it sells for around 240 CNY on jd.com. I have used it for almost two years now. This is great because the things you still use after a year are the things you really need.</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="assets/images/pillow/p.jpg" alt="" class="responsive" />
<em class="caption">Source: jd.com</em></p>

<p>I have bought many things that ended up collecting dust. I needed them and used them for the first days or months, but after that, I rarely used them again. I have other things to do, so I use some products to focus on my priorities and leave other products aside. They are good products, but I don’t have the time or actual need to use them.</p>

<p>For example, I bought a Kindle Scribe for almost 3000 CNY and a Nintendo Switch for around 2000 CNY.</p>

<p>However, this reclining pillow has been helping me a lot, almost every day. I lean on it to work with my laptop. I often use a bolster to support the laptop in a good position for typing.</p>

<p>Another good part about this reclining pillow is that it brings a small headrest, which is good for supporting your head.</p>

<p>When I lived in my apartment, before I slept every day, I would put the large reclining pillow in the corner of my bed. My twin bed is really large.</p>

<p>However, when I moved to my parents’ house, I had only a small bottom bed of a bunk bed. When I sleep, I put the reclining pillow on the chairs and take out my sleeping pillow. Then I can sleep.</p>

<p>I even made a bed laptop desk for myself years ago. But the problem with it was that it limited my activity as my body had to pass under the desk. When I stood up, I had to lift the desk and move away. And because it was made of wood, it was firm. It didn’t feel good, and I had to touch it often. The bolster, made of cloth, is soft to interact with. Another problem was that the bed laptop desk took up a large amount of space.</p>

<p>Space is important. A friend told me that one reason he gave up his cargo transport business was that his van had two rows of seats, which made the actual cargo space narrower compared to competitors, and he didn’t want to buy a new type of van.</p>

<p>There are still areas to improve in this kind of reclining pillow. A smart design feature of this product is separating the big pillow into two parts and allowing them to adjust to different angles. One suggestion is that the manufacturer could make more types of it in different sizes. While keeping the smart design, the manufacturer could make a size that is 2/3 of its current width. This would make it easier to store or organize without sacrificing much of its benefits.</p>
